1gmdhsh,PS5 Pro Impressions ,"Just thought I’d leave my review of the PS5 Pro as someone who games on a 4090. 

I have to say this console is really good for what you are getting I’m quite enjoying my time with the system. 

A lot of the games with the Pro update play really well & look sharp….they look & perform a lot closer to PC titles with these upgrades in my opinion. It’s obviously not close to high end PC level except Forbidden West that one looks almost similar to PC Ultra it’s stunning…..it’s a good step in the right direction 

Playing games like Final Fantasy Rebirth with fidelity& performance more tolerable than the PS5 version is very nice. 4K native 120 for GT7 is phenomenal has me wishing it was like that at launch because it plays a lot better now. Just waiting on the patch. 

I’d say if you’re cool with your regular PS5 experience then not worth it but if you want to experience PlayStation games running closer to PC performance for a good price for what you get I’d say it’s worth it.

I just bought a PS5 coming from PS4 and wanted some exclusives I couldn't play prior, hence why I had to do some research. I hope it helps you!",965,0.9,316,Icalivy,4028.0,PS5,2024-10-21T03:16:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1g8jwka/all_ps5_exclusives_not_on_ps4_list/,critical,False,"pc,playstation,xbox,switch",Optional mode,"glitch,broken,error,lag",0.039960247750102824,0.4750313347414798

**TL;DR:** Bought a used original dock and converted it into a smaller, more portable version.

Recently after getting my Switch, I went deep down the charging and docking rabbit hole. I thought I did my research, but wow, I was way off! There’s so much I didn’t know—docks, accessories, charging standards, you name it. The chances of bricking the switch, plus, the number of fake ""original"" chargers on the market is insane. Honestly, I think even some authorized Nintendo sellers can’t tell the difference. If you’re interested, I will do a separate post comparing real vs. fake chargers. But this post is all about docks—yes, plural. I checked out a few 'recommended' third-party options before deciding to stick the original dock.

# Genki Covert Dock:

It’s got mixed reviews. The concept is great, it’s super compact, and it’s the smallest out there, but there are some dealbreakers:

* It might still brick your Switch.
* Bricked on it's own
* HDMI might stop working
* The HDMI port is pointless if you're not using the display feature.
* Lower power output (even their Covert Dock 2 only supports 45W).
* Brightness issue
* flickering
* Unresponsive CS.
* Pricey.

**Amazon reviews:**  
4.5/5 reviews, do checkout 1 to 3 stars and evaluating yourself.  
[https://www.amazon.com/Global-Covert-Charger-Nintendo-Portable/dp/B0CRXZ6RM6?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Global-Covert-Charger-Nintendo-Portable/dp/B0CRXZ6RM6?th=1)

[Display function stop working after few months](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/kxsxox/comment/gjzxnpq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**General overall bad reviews was:**

* HDMI working with just couple of uses
* The dock dead within a year or after

# Skull & Co JumpGate Pro:

Another one with mixed reviews. It has a cool, slim design and a detachable USB hub, which is clever. But here are the issues I found:

* Sleep/wake problems on Sony TV. [Source: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoPH/comments/131sidu/comment/k9czeeg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
* The spring push mechanism can get stuck.
* Docking isn’t seamless; aligning the USB-C is tricky without the proper alignment support like the original dock.
* Confirmed with their CS, It only works with the original Switch adapter, likely because they are not using a proper PD chip.
* And honestly, their skull logo? Kinda ugly—definitely a reason I skipped their slim case.

# Almost give up

After going through all that, I said screw it and stick with my original dock. I didn’t want to risk bricking my Switch. After some research again turns out, there were custom shells for the original dock back in the day, but they’re hard to find now. Also, the idea that the Switch doesn’t use proper PD charging? Total myth.

# Original Dock and AC Adapter:

The original dock and adapter support PD 2.0 and DCP with two power outputs:

* 5V 1.5A
* 15V 2.6A

Any decent **45W PD** charger should work for dock mode. However, some **Anker GaNPrime** chargers don’t work, but they’ll still charge the Switch itself fine.

# Recommended Charging Cable

While doing my research, I also found recommendations for charging cables that should work perfectly with the dock. Here’s what to look for:

* **45W and above PD Type-C cable**
* **Proper PD Type-C cable with a** [56k ohm resistor](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/ckaiiv/an_engineers_pov_on_the_3rd_party_dock_switch/) (recommended for safe charging)
* **Any reputable branded PD cables** should work fine.

# Custom Shells:

I found two custom shell options:

**Aolion DIY Case:**

* The CS is pretty clueless.
* The new shell has a built-in big LED, but it’s bulky and ugly.
* Can't tell if which shell works with OLED dock.
* The installation instructions are vague and miss key steps.
* The shell looks flimsy.

**ExtremeRate AiryDock DIY Kit:**

* Super detailed install instructions on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gWbhvnb5Lyw?si=INb6HbeThICWxrKc).
* Compatible with both the regular and OLED dock.
* Better design and higher quality.
* Well-packaged with spare parts.
* Few colors and design choice.

# Installation:

During the disassembly, I accidentally broke the OLED dock's LED. The dock still works fine, but I just cannot let it go, so I had to source a replacement LED from China (because, of course, you can get *anything* from China).

I also added dust filters to the shell vents, which I think looks way better and keeps the dust out.

After the conversation, I added 3 rubber dust blockers for USB and Ethernet port.

# My ‘Portable’ Setup:

* Switch OLED
* UGreen PD 60W Type-C cable with built-in 56kΩ chip
* UGreen 65W GaN 2C1A 3-port PD charger
* SmallRig ultra-slim 4K HDMI cable
* Original dock reshelled with the ExtremeRate AiryDock (I seriously hope they come up with a better name).

[Switch OLED+HDMI\/Type-C Cables+Reshell Dock+ 65W Charger](https://preview.redd.it/k0a8fy0zfvvd1.jpg?width=3786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=052c27b60c8bc2e21a4a9cc2d99445c50abc0b6f)

Overall, this is my perfect setup, and it didn’t cost much (aside from that replacement LED I broke). I already had the UGreen charger and cable for years, so the real cost was just getting the used dock and the shell. The DIY process was pretty straightforward, and now I don’t have to worry about a third-party dock bricking my Switch.

If you’re curious, I can dive into the whole fake charger mess in another post. Thanks for reading, and happy gaming!

1gl89ea,"I literally do not care what they add to the Switch 2, I just want them to fix all quality control issues","I remember the days of the Wii and DS. Both of those systems were built like tanks. They were built well and felt like high quality products. And through all the years of abuse I put them through, never once did they break or start having problems

Meanwhile every single official Nintendo Switch product (joy cons, pro controller, console itself, dock) I own has had something break or stop working on me. And I treated every single one of those items with an unbelievable amount of care. Buttons were unresponsive, joysticks drifted. And every time I sent one back to Nintendo on warranty, they would send me a new one that would start showing issues of its own within only a few weeks. So eventually I stopped bothering with sending them back

I don’t care if they changed almost nothing with the Switch 2.

Cheers,

The [r/NintendoSwitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/) mod team",665,0.94,693,NintendoSwitchMods,146678.0,NintendoSwitch,2024-11-04T09:51:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1gjg24h/mario_luigi_brothership_review_megathread/,medium,False,switch,,glitch,-0.004857142857142855,0.09723809523809525
1gcaaag,"For those wondering about the issues with Version 19.0.0, I managed to call support and speak with a supervisor.","The supervisor I got to talk to said he was going to relay the info as feedback to Nintendo. I made sure to explain that stuff like overheating and sleep mode not working right was happening to others, but also had to clarify that I'm having similar issues with my Switch. He said this was the first he heard of it, and thought the issue probably isn't as widespread as it seemed. I clarified I felt it wasn't widespread but was enough of an issue as it affected multiple people. I should also note that my brother has a Switch, and he didn't have any issues like these. Granted, he primarily plays the Switch docked, but still.

So, yeah, here's hoping this can lead to a potential fix for the firmware. I also wanna mention that the supervisor in question is a pretty chill guy. Very understanding, considerate, and wanted to make sure to explore all options, including suggesting that I send the console in for repair *juuuuuuuust* in case the firmware isn't the main cause of it.

I'm gonna be keeping an eye on my Switch for the time being, as well, and will turn it off completely after use just to be safe.

Update: 19.0.1 has come, but it looks like, at least in my case, there are still issues. Battery still drains a bit quickly even in sleep mode, and I had a game paused during the credits with the Switch on the home menu. When I got back to it, it was further ahead in the credits. Not by a lot as it went slowly, but still an issue. Will put in a support request at [support.nintendo.com](http://support.nintendo.com) tomorrow. If you're still having issues, especially ones like this, I suggest you do the same. The more people tell them about this, the more likely a fix will happen.",464,0.89,171,crazyseandx,21840.0,NintendoSwitch,2024-10-25T21:40:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1gcaaag/for_those_wondering_about_the_issues_with_version/,medium,False,switch,,"issue,not working,fix",0.13942857142857143,0.5162063492063492
1gm4390,"Thank the heavens! Mario & Luigi Brothership has large, readable text! Please developers, make your text readable on the Switch!","I'm so tired of playing RPGs and text-heavy games where you have to squint to read the text in handheld or you can't play it from for far away on the TV because the text is tiny! I was surprised when even some Nintendo and Square Enix titles had this problem (you know you would think they would know best from their long production of text-heavy games and heavy experience with handheld and mobile titles). 

I've been playing Brothership and other than the shockingly great soundtrack (every track has stood out so far as stunning) and the vibrant coloring and animation, what I instantly noticed is it's so good to see large, easily readable text in this game. When I first saw the first dialogue encounters and tutorial text, I was so relieved. I couldn't believe that even in some Nintendo titles this generation they seemed to have forgotten their UI design from previous titles (maybe a part of Nintendo who had never worked in the handheld division).

I hope going forward this is a sign that Nintendo and other developers won't make the same mistakes on the Switch successor. I'm tired of the myriad games that simply assume you're playing up close at your desk on a PC monitor and how they design UIs to fit the most information possible in the smallest space rather than to be readable. It's especially appreciated when text is large because complex Chinese characters are a lot harder to read when they're squished together.",397,0.93,49,RyanoftheStars,14021.0,NintendoSwitch,2024-11-07T18:13:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1gm4390/thank_the_heavens_mario_luigi_brothership_has/,medium,False,"pc,switch","up close at your desk on a PC monitor and how they design UIs to fit the most information possible in the smallest space rather than to be readable,this,RPGs and text,Brothership and other than the shockingly great soundtrack ",problem,0.12717352092352097,0.4980158730158729
