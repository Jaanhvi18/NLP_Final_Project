184e4zj,"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results","# Explanation and methodology

I compiled fourteen different ""best of all time"" lists to create one definitive list. It was originally going to be a top 100 but I ended up having enough data to make a consensus top 200. For each list I gave each game a score based on placement (i.e. one point for 100th place, two points for 99th place, all the way up to 100 points for 1st place). I also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 

# Lists used

I averaged together the following lists, with diverse perspectives and recent publication being a priority in which lists I chose: 

**Media rankings**: Empire (UK, 2023), USA Today (US, 2022), Popular Mechanics (US, 2022), Looper (US, 2022) IGN (international, 2021), Slant magazine (USA, 2020) Game Informer (US, 2018) Games TM (UK, 2018)

**Critic ratings**: Metacritic top 200 Metascores of all time (as of 2023)

**Gamer ratings**: IMDB top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023), Ranker top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023)

**Critic polls**: British GQ Industry Poll (UK, 2023)

**Gamer polls:** TV Asahi viewer poll (Japan, 2021), Hobby Consolas reader poll (Spain/Latin America, 2021)

# THE LIST

Here is the final top 200 list:

1. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
2. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
3. Grand Theft Auto V
4. The Last of Us
5. Tetris
6. Resident Evil 4
7. Metal Gear Solid
8. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
9. Super Mario 64
10. BioShock
11. Final Fantasy VII
12. Super Mario Bros 3

1. **Reyna does not teach players to position well**

Imagine this scenario where, on round start, a defender runs it down B long on bind looking for a pick and runs into the entire enemy team.



https://preview.redd.it/itb7rjtij93d1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=014c7a78036772c02a4c5c31d116d240483ee359

Your average scenario here with almost any agent is that you run out into a 1v5 and die. You'd probably think to yourself ""wow all 5 of them were there, that was a dumb spot to stand. I should play further back so I can escape or get a teammate to double peek with me and use util to secure.""

Now let's swap that out for Reyna.



https://preview.redd.it/mj45oq5xj93d1.png?width=196&format=png&auto=webp&s=eebb66eab754fd9aa19c11a82baa085ad7b83709

Reyna runs out, sees 5 enemies and dies, but instead the lesson learned is

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**

Reyna will then try the same strategy again, and when she gets a kill she is rewarded and her behaviour is reinforced by dismissing and retreating back to site.



**2. Reyna does not teach players how to effectively use utility for anyone other than herself**



https://preview.redd.it/dyvll0njl93d1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb8cb060f386c66c2cf894934bb6c329d58722f6

Reyna's only situational piece of utility is a near-sight blind. She is the only character in the entire game that has a castable blind with **NO** downsides. Every single other ability in the game that blinds **affects your  teammates**. It's also one of 2 blinds in the entire game that **goes through walls**. If you throw a skye flash directly out into the middle of a fight or throw your omen blind from the backline you could blind your whole team and lose the fight.

Picture this scenario on Ascent A-site. Attacker team is doing a full push against 3 defenders on A.



https://preview.redd.it/0hmt91xsm93d1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=39208c9ae239c788a6b611aeba6acc96c8302fa1

If omen misuses his blind here, he blinds the Jett playing dice, but also blinds his Deadlock and Clove. This puts the attackers at a massive disadvantage. Omen's team loses the push and Omen gets flamed for team flashing. Omen, who wants to avoid this in the future, learns from his mistake. He now knows that he needs to stand off to the side, or be aware of where his teammates are standing when he throws his blind.

Now we swap omen out for Reyna



https://preview.redd.it/0o1eiqwin93d1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=434d197e7ce86b471bdef99ea5e1ee5b2c590fe5

Reyna can throw her blind anywhere, in any situation. It blinds anyone who can see it from any range. Reyna's team pushes the site, and if Reyna and her team dies her only lesson to be learned again is

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**

**3. Reyna does not teach players how to effectively use ultimate abilities**

Every single ultimate ability in this game **except for Reyna's** has a set of use case scenarios, and a set of non-use case scenarios. For example, you wouldn't phoenix ult in the middle of site, you'd get punished. You wouldn't use your kj ult in mid, you'd get punished. Reyna's ultimate is the only ultimate in the entire game that can be used effectively on round start **every time it's available.** There is no downside to using the Reyna ult, you cannot disadvantage or kill your teammates with the Reyna ult, you cannot put yourself at a disadvantage with the Reyna ult. You cannot waste the Reyna ult by any measure other than inactivity. The only lesson to be learned from dying and losing the Reyna ult is, again:

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**



**4. Reyna does not teach players about trade opportunities**

Reyna's dismiss and heal mechanics effectively allow her to cancel or heavily mitigate any trade opportunities presented to her enemies.

https://preview.redd.it/l54e3lr4q93d1.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=05edc1773df62f96f4a8e5f20c7658ab50469eea

In this scenario on Split's mail/heaven area, lets pretend it's pistol round and everyone here has a ghost and no armor. Fade has swung into the Harbor. Fade gets the jump on Harbor and although Harbor manages to heavily tag the Fade, she secures the kill on him. As soon as this happens Gekko, who is nearby is able to quickly swing into position before the Fade is ready and secure the kill, trading out his teammate and securing the round. If Gekko is faster and both players are able to fight Fade together, she is very likely to still lose, even if she kills the Harbor. Fade has learned a valuable lesson in that if she is taking a fight, she needs to be prepared for someone else to swing her and take measures, such as backing off the angle and re-positioning, using dog to stop the trade, or playing a safer angle to begin with. If Fade takes damage in a fight, she's less likely to win the next fight and will likely be traded out. Now lets swap Fade out for Reyna:



https://preview.redd.it/atvodso5r93d1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=50dafcbcfccb20ba05780b14cccfd2cec73ce700



Again, lets pretend it's pistol round and all 3 players have a ghost. Reyna pushes and while Harbor manages to heavily tag her, Reyna secures the kill. Reyna immediately activates her heal and is suddenly swung by Gekko. She now has more health than she had when she was fighting Harbor, and is able to secure the kill on Gekko as well. Reyna does not have to worry about being tagged and easily traded out on low-hp, and therefore does not need to have a plan to disengage. If Gekko is able to swing before Harbor is killed, as long as Reyna gets the kill on Harbor, she is able to dismiss and disengage from the fight and cancel the trade for free. If Reyna loses this fight, the only lesson to be learned is, again:

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**



So where does this leave players that only play Reyna? They've learned in almost every situation that their aim was poor and that they just needed to secure the kill to win. Every win condition in Valorant is getting the kill. There are no nuances or complex mechanics to interact with in this game **as long as you get the kill**. You do not need to perfect your utility usage and site takes **as long as you get the kill.** You don't need to worry about being traded **as long as you get the kill**.

**What are the consequences of this?**

We've seen from the above examples that Reyna is far too easy and far too forgiving to players, and while other players using different agents are climbing the ranks learning a wide variety of skills such as effective utility usage, strategy, positioning, teamwork and other meta-knowledge, Reyna players are learning that their only mistake was not getting the kill.

1bfw78y,About Woohoojin,"**I have requested to speak to Woohoojin directly, I have already messaged him, my Discord is mykl0, Hooj. (He has not made any attempt to reach out)**

A minority of people seem to misunderstand the greater issue here. Influential figures deserve to be held accountable for the actions that they take (or in this case, refuse to take for their own image). You can appreciate the art but not the artist, everyone here understands that. However, that's not what this is about.

**The streamed response Woohoojin made includes**

1. **He** **still has a mysterious Radiant alt that he cannot show to be ""Petty"" - as if this wouldn't be the simplest option to immediately resolve all of this in seconds (hence still lying)**
2. **He was different in the past (Even though he has claimed to be radiant up until this controversy took place, so he never had plans on stopping)**
3. **He believes the content and charity streams he made are sufficient to atone for this lie - only made possible by the short term clout boost achieved through going against riot TOS**
4. **He has** ***NOT*** **mentioned the coaching auctions**
5. **When asked if he did ever hit radiant, he claims he did, but does not have proof. The same person who has hundreds of hours of recordings marking his whole journey from silver to immortal as I understand. Seems like a pretty big deal to have radiant recorded.**
6. **He seems to be unable to acknowledge the concept of why this is such a big deal, with money, time, and trust involved by multiple other groups of people that would, quite literally, buy into it.**

# Woohoojin has not made any indication that he has seen this post, saying the arguments provided are coming from ""the haters."" He has not come out honestly yet, instead making a lackluster and insincere apology to the people who are still following him and his fraudulent words. He is still choosing to lie, that is how much respect he has for his community.

**-  I also want to add that Charlatan now believes he has not hit radiant on his own either**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/idlab979nqoc1.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cf05267d4df5458ac9d84b00886387617a11e9c

**It seems as though the path (Woohoojin, his mods, and JeyG) have chosen to take is to cover-up and de-escalate, in an attempt to have this blow over. Woohoojin himself has made the decision to see how many lies he can lean on in the meantime, using trust built from what was also, a lie.**

\--

Commenters in the thread thought it was important to add, **""Woohoojin frequently claims that he peaked Challenger in League of Legends as a way to market his credibility and skills as a coach. He particularly builds on this narrative in his earlier videos when he first started out and had less credibility as a coach (**[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycxbLCWMdM**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nycxbLCWMdM)**) - the youtube video is an example.**

However, upon further examination, while it is true that he did peak in Challenger, he peaked in flexQ and not soloQ. He peaked Diamond 4 in soloQ, and Challenger in flexQ during season 8.  For further clarification, in the League of Legends community, flexQ is seen as a less serious more chill queue to play with friends - it is not really seen as a competitive queue, and definitely not seen as a legitimate measure of skill.

While there isn't a perfect analogy to Valorant, the closest I can think of is if you 5 stack with lower rated friends to boost you to radiant (I say closest because you can flexQ with people of similar soloQ rank/skill in league, but the point still remains that the flexQ rank obtained is **not taken seriously** in the community)  People will always assume soloQ when someone talks about their peak rank in league. **So while it is technically true that he peaked in Challenger, him keeping it vague as to which queue he achieved this on is purposely misleading and disingenuous**. **""**

**--**

**I want to clarify that the screenshot of him playing with Bronzes was only used because it was the most recent game on his account. I do not want to try to portray him in a misguided light, claiming that he is also account-boosting. That was most likely a community event he was doing with his fans. There is nothing wrong with that, I used it as an example to show the tag (Woohoojin#Coach). Do not let that take away from the post.**

**EDIT 2 -- Woohoojin has made an acknowledgment about this. Along with a full video that you can find on his discord / most likely clipped on twitch.**

[This still does not take away from the fact that this is against TOS](https://preview.redd.it/k7r3iwlqimoc1.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=c074d2c972e9eda57eb908b11fbff89368944b6c)

**I will not give any credit to him for this action, coming out after you've been exposed in this manner is not an act of genuine courtesy. This should have been mentioned LONG before.**

**EDIT 3 -- It seems as though JeyG has privatized the VOD, most likely at the request of Woohoojin. This is the path they have chosen to take. I attached another screenshot of the match he is playing, with twitch chat to add authenticity to my claim.**

**EDIT 4 -- I just wanted to point out, as** u/curelullaby **mentioned, he has had auctions for his coaching, only feasible due to his status. I will copy their comment, with links to the information about the auctions here. Thank you** u/curelullaby\*\*. ""\*\*

# M A I N  P O S T :

I will keep this short, but after getting insta-banned from the Woohoojin discord I thought this post would be fitting. Woohoojin was boosted to radiant by streamer JeyG who most likely did it in a deal that would give Woohoojin more marketability after being seen as radiant coach with a high rr peak. Woohoojin never **publicly** hit radiant, nor has any proof, yet he lies that this was his account. Any discussion of this will get you banned from his discord.

This match is the first piece of evidence. [https://tracker.gg/valorant/match/42dd95be-dd90-4f2b-b9ea-721596fe47bd](https://tracker.gg/valorant/match/42dd95be-dd90-4f2b-b9ea-721596fe47bd)

This entire game that is shown in that tracker was streamed LIVE on JeyG's twitch account with the name TTV JeyG (Visible after the match, the names in the match line up). This is the VOD ->

&#x200B;

The second piece of evidence, is in Valorant itself using the leaderboard. If you look at Woohoojin's profile on [Tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg/), you can see he peaked 317 rr the act before he hit radiant. (Episode 3 act 2). If you go to this spot in **the valorant leaderboards** who do you see?

And what happens if you hit view career?

It is clear why he did this, marketing yourself as a radiant coach would **make your services more appealing**. You may argue that his services are free (most likely a mix of **guilt** from this predicament and business model) but it does not subtract from the fact tha**t his community has been lied to about this on a daily basis**. He is not the player who he claims to be. I think that transparency is important, which is why I created this post. I have no ulterior motive, I just do not like the lack of honesty.

There is more evidence, like for example, his account mained duelist with a 1.x KD during the period where he was a 723 rr radiant player, and immediately after that point (which is when JeyG transferred the account to him), he played controller and sunk to immortal with objectively bad stats. No radiant who has played every single day since that point would struggle to play duelist in ascendant lobbies. It is simply ridiculous. The final thing I want to bring attention to is JeyG's twitter. Look at his Bio.

Like, thanks? But why are you helping the enemy team, bro?

The first time I was playing against him I knew shit about his abilities and when I found myself in the **deadly** pond of water I thought that was the end but this kind man's advice saved my life.

I was so unprepared of an enemy helping me that I thought someone from my team sudjested me moooving through the voice chat.

So I wonder why people are not so willing to play this agent, lmao.

Isn't him helping like this considered sabotaging or griefing btw?
