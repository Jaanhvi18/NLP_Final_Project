include the playoffs one now they're up	0.00	5.52
to 18 games absolutely crazy stuff so	1.56	5.719
they definitely a lot of homework for	5.52	3.999
loud to read but are ready for the game	7.28	4.081
for sure and send cities here behind	9.52	3.921
them the loud fans already get into that	11.36	4.919
Volume 11 as well as we start off here	13.44	5.52
on Sunset for the grand finals a lot of	16.28	5.0
tiles work from sen just to make sure	18.96	5.399
that mid area is controlled from loud it	21.28	4.84
feels like loud's being real passive	24.36	3.361
here they're ready to go for a first	26.12	3.961
round retake with whatever sensal hits	27.72	4.16
only on that midt there was a lot of	30.08	2.8
pressure on both sides from the	31.88	2.48
initiator getting information on the	32.88	3.48
extremities and now as you mentioned	34.36	3.84
playing the retake stop for out there's	36.36	3.84
still a first Contact from tuis throwing	38.20	4.8
up paranoia keeping clis at B from s	40.20	4.359
finally a first Contact but the heavy	43.00	4.079
damage goes on to John cuy sels get	44.56	3.921
still want to move forward in this	47.08	5.0
pistol and Loud decide to pull	48.48	3.599
back smoke happening on left side lane	52.36	4.2
clearing out towards the left side	55.20	4.0
actually probably get 2 CK right now as	56.56	4.48
a one way smoke comes up Sentinels tries	59.20	3.721
to execute in it actually does hit Q G	61.04	3.241
for at the back of the sight there's the	62.92	3.64
first Blood dropped by the sels a second	64.28	5.6
as well by Z and cloud is falling down	66.56	5.36
on this pistol with the spike down on	69.88	5.2
the east side for S fantastic job at not	71.92	5.48
allowing loud to get into a positioning	75.08	4.719
as we kind of saw on Ascent they can't	77.40	4.52
get this utility these flashes in order	79.80	4.921
that sad Dart in place and Sentinels	81.92	4.76
bite back before the retake even really	84.72	4.28
happens there Les now a few final kills	86.68	4.119
on the exit to hopefully collect some	89.00	4.079
money for the squad in a a different buy	90.80	4.041
next round but we'll see a lot of teams	93.08	4.161
have been full classic saving out on	94.84	4.84
that second round favoring a bit of	97.24	4.64
utility we'll see if loud decides to do	99.68	4.6
that Sentinels pick up the first round	101.88	4.199
and they start off with a little bit of	104.28	3.68
a cross the map they were looking mid	106.08	3.64
first then they were moving over to the	107.96	4.4
side of a but they took it slow again	109.72	4.601
something different we're seeing with	112.36	3.92
John cuy and Sentinels that they'll work	114.32	4.04
the map a bit before actually making	116.28	4.36
that commitment	118.36	4.399
with loud seems they were heavily	120.64	3.64
pressured that retake style they wanted	122.76	3.72
to get SEL wanted to continue to fight	124.28	3.92
forward after that Spike plan now	126.48	4.0
putting themselves for alloud on defense	128.20	4.16
on a stack towards the BS side setting	130.48	5.081
up for potentially a trap play but maybe	132.36	4.68
getting information first you already	135.56	3.2
see out in the open sadak is just	137.04	6.12
waiting for a contact for a push anybody	138.76	6.88
towards the B main sign you even see	143.16	4.28
kenzine trying to play a little tricky	145.64	4.56
hide spot in the market major he is just	147.44	4.28
waiting for that wall to go up and catch	150.20	3.92
somebody off guard again the slow play	151.72	3.92
from Sentinels they're they're pretty	154.12	4.199
much repeating first round strap right	155.64	4.8
we see that Zin and John cuy are working	158.32	4.761
tiles this time they proceed into mid	160.44	3.96
but that door is going to be shut on	163.08	3.64
them right quick looks like they could	164.40	3.4
go all the way through here this is	166.72	2.599
going to be trouble for loud to regain	167.80	3.519
any positioning loud's been good at it	169.32	4.0
so far continuing the good reads always	171.32	3.321
being active around the map on their	173.32	3.361
defensive side back towards the spawn	174.64	4.08
they here Sentinel stopping towards the	176.68	3.88
aite again they there is some sort of	178.72	3.519
Hope Here If tuis There He Go gets that	180.56	4.2
contact onto 10 slowing the pace of the	182.24	4.761
attack instantly traded out by John cuy	184.76	3.96
though as the plant goes down for beat	187.00	3.519
for a	188.72	4.4
main triple push forward but the cross	190.52	4.64
is just too good for Sentinels they do a	193.12	4.32
little bit of damage here for L and you	195.16	3.64
know what I'm not going to Discount this	197.44	4.56
player qck finally pushed forward by Z	198.80	5.601
and SEL get the second round all right	202.00	5.319
two patient rounds from Sentinels they	204.40	4.759
pretty much walk themselves into a	207.32	3.64
situation where they're fighting loud	209.16	4.08
the first one ended up at a on pistol	210.96	3.84
that second one they were able to find	213.24	3.441
their fight as they push Behind Enemy	214.80	4.0
Lines in mid which also works out for	216.68	4.4
Sen because now they have a bit of map	218.80	4.601
info of how loud will play those lower	221.08	4.359
by rounds whether or not they were	223.40	4.759
covering mid L maybe can read a bit into	225.44	5.08
it once they see it again all that	228.16	5.44
information helps so now what can L do	230.52	5.92
they tried the B stack that default take	233.60	4.72
on a for first round did not work but	236.44	3.561
they're going to heavy stack towards a	238.32	3.441
here as we get a bigger default from	240.00	3.76
Sentinels and I'm interested to see if	241.76	4.6
loud does a bit of the extremity pushing	243.76	4.759
here they need each other to get back	246.36	4.599
for this initiator utility on the retake	248.52	4.36
so losing somebody on a peak would be	250.96	3.881
detrimental to loud they're going to	252.88	6.04
stay back and play a very passive o game	254.84	6.28
except for that player except for that	258.92	4.641
two gets dropped instantly Sentinels	261.12	5.72
once again in a power play John Cy still	263.56	4.76
lurking around towards this B sign	266.84	2.919
trying to see if you can hear rotate out	268.32	3.439
of market so for sentinals it's still an	269.76	4.081
information game for loud it's the	271.76	3.481
aggression we talked about the	273.84	2.76
extremities but this time it's towards	275.24	3.92
the there's the contact on a few finally	276.60	5.159
gets traded out but we're even up on a	279.16	5.44
33 with Z heavily damaged and that lurk	281.76	5.041
though for John cue it's now open it's	284.60	3.879
up to sel to try to figure a way back	286.80	2.959
towards the B site to meet up against	288.48	2.961
the	289.76	4.921
igl going the long way around wouldn't	291.44	5.0
be able to clear mid and do not know	294.68	3.32
what breadcrumbs are left there from the	296.44	4.36
Cowen push yeah they right qck is able	298.00	5.039
to catch this audio and will take a shot	300.80	5.48
easy one placement Z low on HP actually	303.04	4.841
Dodges away from The Flash and made it	306.28	3.68
through getting a plant right now for	307.88	3.64
senal would be pretty	309.96	4.0
decent for this bonus round that they	311.52	5.6
have John C watching Z's back as a plant	313.96	5.56
Comes Down stink bite just dropping down	317.12	5.639
inches away at zin's feet and allows	319.52	4.679
both players now to group together	322.76	2.801
towards the back of the site they see	324.20	3.801
the Recon darts are rotate a flank from	325.56	4.479
sadak towards the B Main	328.00	4.36
qck no more flashes has to move together	330.04	3.481
they have to play the fundamentals now	332.36	3.839
for loud to blaze wall first but another	333.52	5.239
St Bight forcing John Cy out of position	336.20	5.161
a one for one solo second head shot on	338.76	5.44
the first but geted right away by Les a	341.36	5.52
nice trade for loud they convert their	344.20	5.401
gun round but SEL they are definitely	346.88	5.68
happy with that result loud securing	349.60	6.48
that one L with the viper bite on to Z	352.56	6.12
actually paying off in dividends as they	356.08	4.64
follow up on it but you're right so much	358.68	4.079
damage done from Sentinels loud are	360.72	4.08
going to have a bit of trouble reing	362.76	3.921
into this already see some Stingers on	364.80	4.36
the board as we rewatch this play again	366.68	5.32
good teamwork good trade fundamentals on	369.16	4.84
that one keep pressing W until you can	372.00	4.52
get your teammate anchored on that play	374.00	4.4
So a good post plant from loud we see	376.52	3.92
that	378.40	4.199
successful can they keep it up Phoenix	380.44	4.8
ultimate's up they may try to go for an	382.60	4.32
a push here as they already have that	385.24	4.399
sight quite stacked and the only one	386.92	4.361
that's going to be seen as	389.64	4.84
two L having to play once again a gamble	391.28	4.88
stack this time towards B because of	394.48	3.481
that bonus round that SEL had the	396.16	4.08
economy is very low the strongest weapon	397.96	4.359
was the one that was maintained by Les	400.24	4.079
on that previous round which is a vandal	402.32	3.241
and the rest are just looking for that	404.32	3.761
trap play it's up to loud once again to	405.56	4.479
do a lot more rotations around the side	408.08	3.559
have better reads but thankfully they	410.04	3.961
have a scan agent andot who's currently	411.64	5.041
joining towards the B main spots nothing	414.00	4.4
this is good for Sentinel to work the	416.68	4.72
map	418.40	3.0
what a choice John QD again calling it	421.48	5.72
shots the left side of the map here	424.68	4.28
obviously a retake for loud but this	427.20	3.961
should be Sentinels planting pushing	428.96	3.44
forward and actually gaining some	431.16	3.68
position so loud cannot do anything	432.40	4.88
really here on the retake the way	434.84	4.84
Sentinels have been approaching each of	437.28	4.639
their games it seems like they have two	439.68	4.56
variations they can use whether it is 10	441.92	4.68
on the omen where they they they play a	444.24	3.88
game that's centered around this	446.60	3.28
crowding up getting into the sight	448.12	3.359
together and just	449.88	5.201
swarming s a top of the head of s Falls	451.48	5.4
at least for allow they have this	455.08	4.6
running back with qck hoping that sedak	456.88	4.16
was still alive to help with the Recon	459.68	2.959
Dart but it's going to make it a little	461.04	3.481
bit more difficult for loud to retake	462.64	4.28
the site J CU already setting up with	464.52	3.679
the camera so that's going to be the	466.92	2.641
first Contact the rest of the team	468.20	3.241
holding back towards be main looking to	469.56	4.4
just Spam if loud make it through make	471.44	5.039
it through the first line of contact	473.96	5.84
John cuy back Beautiful by celsus it	476.48	5.72
allows for him to get the kill onto less	479.80	4.959
there's qk upgrading weapon M onto the	482.20	4.12
ground the Lays coming out from SEL that	484.76	3.28
clock is ticking down here pains on top	486.32	3.921
of that nice shot though from T as	488.04	4.16
they're leading forward boom to get more	490.24	4.2
scans s dropping two in a beautiful hole	492.20	5.041
for s in the end not even worrying about	494.44	4.319
the smokes that can come through they	497.24	3.76
have all the utility and weaponry to	498.76	4.56
fire back on to loud and that low by	501.00	4.0
hurts all the damage sen did on the	503.32	4.16
bonus round hurts and they pick up a	505.00	5.84
third round now and that that was that	507.48	5.0
that was the one variation of the hit	510.84	3.48
where they can follow zekin in they can	512.48	4.081
make it work on a map like Sunset and	514.32	4.24
then klin can switch up the team and you	516.56	4.919
can get a bind out of this squad that	518.56	5.0
has a yoru forend where they're pushing	521.48	4.401
everywhere they know how to flex and	523.56	4.56
flow between play Styles so well when	525.88	3.92
they get on different agents Sentinels	528.12	3.64
is just showing different this year but	529.80	3.92
we got a whole series to go through and	531.76	4.36
Loud has showed us just as much this	533.72	5.119
season coming into round five this til	536.12	6.399
push is is louds again but T answers two	538.84	4.641
right	542.52	3.681
away but tuis did get a timing he made	543.48	4.599
it through that's going to catched on CU	546.20	4.079
that's allowing to even up the tally for	548.08	3.841
the mid-ring to start a little bit	550.28	4.481
earlier Les even once more no pun	551.92	5.0
intended as we have a fight now towards	554.76	6.4
the a main side instantly leaving sashy	556.92	7.28
alone and they may even taster choice	561.16	5.04
this and by that I mean who's going to	564.20	3.72
kill Sashi do you get an ALT on sadak do	566.20	3.879
you get an ALT on l is it different do	567.92	3.599
you let him get it down and get the alts	570.08	2.841
that way loud's going to be able to	571.52	3.121
circulate these alts in the next few	572.92	3.72
rounds sashy gets the plant and	574.64	3.56
beautiful that he can work off of it	576.64	3.6
with wingman here trash is available if	578.20	5.24
this goes down Sashi may go all out that	580.24	4.68
would be such a gamble but look at him	583.44	3.72
it here all these rotates so he's trying	584.92	3.479
to get an angle he's trying to get a	587.16	3.119
surprise attack here's our first jump	588.40	3.801
spot here's two crossing over the third	590.28	4.161
one already made it through so Sassi now	592.20	4.24
has a timing behind the three players	594.44	3.68
allowed roach it in across there's a	596.44	3.2
stake by towards M now	598.12	3.92
Watchers two and he will have all the	599.64	4.8
kit left now on his Geo kit the mar	602.04	4.32
going down Force the halfway out of	604.44	4.44
position now Les Falls away there's that	606.36	3.919
thrash coming out too from the front of	608.88	3.079
the pillar and Les even has to pull back	610.28	3.481
towards the market it does not hit him	611.96	5.12
though but that clock is taken down s r	613.76	6.639
for the time gets it done and Sass wins	617.08	7.361
a three on one against	620.40	8.361
loud incredible play from sashy you can	624.44	6.8
look at any player on this team and find	628.76	4.04
that type of play coming out of	631.24	6.48
Sentinels here absolutely routing loud	632.80	7.08
listen to that	637.72	5.64
crowd the Saucy call outs come out as	639.88	6.639
his plays go down what a pivotal kill	643.36	6.159
two for 10s for Sentinels to understand	646.52	6.081
the tiles push has been such a priority	649.52	5.921
for L they instantly attack back snap	652.60	5.32
back at L's push when qck comes around	655.44	4.32
the corner and	657.92	6.0
yeah they're feeling that what a play	659.76	5.92
from	663.92	4.359
Sassi absolutely throwing loud's timing	665.68	4.36
off by the wingman plant and push into	668.28	4.281
to Market very heady play we're in round	670.04	5.08
six now a mid playay from loud thinking	672.56	4.2
that Sentinels might go for this	675.12	3.24
encroachment again they have a lot that	676.76	2.8
they can work behind this wall that they	678.36	2.88
just put up there goes that curveball	679.56	5.12
out for qck but do we still fell first s	681.24	4.68
are just anching around they have	684.68	3.08
support from all angles control it in	685.92	4.76
the middle kn chance	687.76	5.4
for through a mid	690.68	6.279
flood with that hat thrown here by joh	693.16	5.96
gives enough information that a site is	696.96	4.201
open it's weaker where sedak is	699.12	4.2
currently only holding with the sheriff	701.16	3.679
even sels they're giving him that	703.32	3.28
respect moving all the way together	704.84	5.401
forming up forming up ORS rather really	706.60	8.12
just working the protocols for the later	710.24	4.48
rounds just the smoke giving them pawn	714.88	5.28
shop control they know Sak right	717.52	5.361
there and another quick wingman plant	720.16	4.88
giving Sentinels so much safety never	722.88	4.84
having to push into the sight remain	725.04	4.32
somehow sedak had an opener had an	727.72	4.239
opportunity to drop JN cue but it's a NL	729.36	6.2
battle won by Sentinels yeah and last	731.96	5.68
again potentially in a situation yeah	735.56	3.2
you already see him back it up he's	737.64	3.481
going to save this one money wasn't too	738.76	4.199
great here for alloud and his half by	741.12	4.24
that they had trap play was read by	742.96	4.801
Sentinels exactly louder doing	745.36	4.36
everything they can to get under the	747.76	3.96
skin of Sentinels find that first kill	749.72	4.239
so they might be able to grab zel's	751.72	3.919
Vandal or whatever he would have in the	753.96	3.961
round and then move it around again	755.64	4.121
right see what Les can get see what can	757.92	5.2
happen Sentinels is avoiding it though	759.76	5.36
they're understanding and respecting the	763.12	3.8
fact that loud can still do a lot of	765.12	3.92
damage on these Low by rounds and you're	766.92	4.76
not seeing any wide swings that don't	769.04	4.44
have an anchor of a sentinel member on	771.68	4.56
it very controlled play Here by send	773.48	4.0
understanding their wing condition and	776.24	4.0
holding it close to the chest four	777.48	4.799
ultimates for loud very big swing point	780.24	4.12
in the game we get another timeout right	782.28	4.761
away oh my gosh should be the first one	784.36	6.56
here after all okay okay yeah so now	787.04	4.919
just trying to figure out what they can	790.92	2.68
do with this	791.96	4.041
probably as we had an inkling that a	793.60	3.599
timeout should have come out on that	796.00	3.16
previous round that lower buy that we	797.20	3.44
had from loud is just for him to decide	799.16	3.0
okay we got four alss to work with this	800.64	4.361
time around but that doesn't take away	802.16	4.2
any of the point that you mentioned so	805.00	4.399
far with that the ski round loss in a	806.36	5.32
row you're going to get 2900 into the	809.40	4.88
pockets of loud that's basically on no	811.68	4.68
credits is they have to spend in again	814.28	4.12
they need to use these ultimates to get	816.36	3.88
some rounds back now or it's going to	818.40	4.8
start swinging very heavily in favor of	820.24	5.24
sen already they swing heavily over	823.20	4.841
towards the right side to pressure main	825.48	5.279
pop flash going right into back alley	828.04	4.239
and it definitely looks like for louds	830.76	2.681
side they want to try to use that right	832.28	2.68
away there's the p on the first one	833.44	3.519
already the ig's backing up trying to	834.96	3.841
get the hury out and there it is it does	836.96	4.12
get a ping on a feud and with flashes	838.80	3.92
coming across it does get contact for	841.08	4.281
Ping but Zen still opens up Sentinels	842.72	4.44
were working towards the midside after a	845.36	4.2
trap play attempted by L with these alss	847.16	4.08
now Les is going to be in heavy trouble	849.56	3.839
towards the market he's there alone and	851.24	3.599
he's just trying to Anchor up at least	853.40	4.36
one portion of this bite towards the map	854.84	4.68
while the rest are pushing double	857.76	4.041
towards aong zelus is currently waiting	859.52	3.961
he lost his teammate in the process but	861.80	3.479
he gets the Dink and the kill on to tuis	863.48	3.68
the flash turns away from it and does	865.28	4.12
not connect on the second one Cowen	867.16	4.64
walks outway out of that fight limping	869.40	4.041
away but still has that support from	871.80	4.0
sadak three on three now in the mid	873.44	5.72
round finding fights around the map loud	875.80	5.92
trying to pick apart at sentinel's Team	879.16	4.64
before they hit these sights finally we	881.72	3.4
just talked about it they couldn't find	883.80	3.0
any ground before it always be quickly	885.12	4.88
traded back now the 3v3	886.80	6.52
stands unless gets traded out yep in	890.00	5.32
these moments during this kickoff has	893.32	4.079
been so good and he anchored position to	895.32	4.519
drop two and three has been a superstar	897.40	5.761
player but now SEL coming out this	899.84	5.68
game the basics the fundamentals are	903.16	4.0
looking very good to get	905.52	4.841
a coming out looking around the	907.16	6.0
TP Co moving forward looks like tens is	910.36	4.2
looking for a fight he gets punished	913.16	3.0
right away by sadak as the Rolling	914.56	3.76
Thunder comes out now even the P comes	916.16	5.239
out beautiful combination of utility	918.32	6.72
from loud as they drop zasi and come in	921.40	5.481
for the diffuse and we talked about how	925.04	4.919
big this round was loud stays off going	926.88	5.519
into economy hell right now that was	929.96	4.56
such a big round Sentinels would have	932.40	4.12
been running away with a few more and	934.52	3.481
this first half would have not looked	936.52	4.161
good now we have loud coming back up	938.00	4.199
here still going to be a buy coming in	940.68	3.68
from sen it seems yeah they should be	942.20	3.681
able to get that low armor	944.36	5.599
in see this again too the the retake it	945.88	7.48
had to happen for loud to use the the	949.96	5.841
the Rolling Thunder everything they had	953.36	5.08
it was according to the play this had to	955.80	4.24
be be	958.44	4.56
secured oh Saucy not get out of that one	960.04	5.08
you see they're still vibing loud knows	963.00	4.319
this game isn't out of hand it's not	965.12	4.639
crazy the few rounds down means nothing	967.32	5.241
to sadak and Loud still very much in it	969.76	5.0
and let's see how they play that always	972.56	4.279
on ph the judg is there for sedak so you	974.76	3.401
know they're starting to get a little	976.84	3.161
ratty on these we'll see how that gets	978.16	4.799
used and these ultimates as well QC K	980.00	5.519
can still go in a quick retake and Les	982.96	4.841
just pushes him out with the Viper pit	985.52	4.521
we have yet to see how loud actually	987.80	4.64
fight back with those you see loud	990.04	4.32
though just jingling across the contact	992.44	3.56
being those controllers Less in the back	994.36	5.32
of the site two on the a site it looks	996.00	5.759
like senel want to activate right away	999.68	4.88
they com in out from zelus second	1001.76	5.401
Satchel to cross contact on players from	1004.56	4.48
loud in the back of Boba as a plant	1007.16	3.239
comes in for sental it's time for them	1009.04	3.239
to play the pulse plant once again but	1010.40	3.56
this time around nobody holding yet	1012.28	3.081
towards the back of the B main it's a	1013.96	3.24
paranoid to push through and you hear	1015.36	4.159
that run it back should come across the	1017.20	5.161
save comes out from Les as it allows qyk	1019.52	5.001
to stay alive a whole roster of loud	1022.36	4.079
against three left of Sentinels paranoia	1024.52	3.6
being thrown on defense there's that	1026.44	3.441
judge more utility flooding towards the	1028.12	4.079
front but celsus and tense are holding	1029.88	4.0
back their ground for now beautiful	1032.20	4.48
flash out fromus though now the tap on	1033.88	4.28
the spike trying to draw out the	1036.68	3.721
opponents beautifully done by	1038.16	4.72
loud they come in for the diffuse and	1040.40	5.12
you saw some hope there from zelus and	1042.88	5.319
10 and Loud instantly they held back for	1045.52	5.2
a Split Second four Sentinels out and	1048.20	4.001
finally played the fundamentals in won	1050.72	4.319
the round that's the loud train I think	1052.20	5.04
we've been looking for it took a little	1055.04	4.801
bit to stoke the fire but man coming	1057.24	4.52
down the tracks you do not want to be in	1059.84	3.719
the way of loud when they feel like the	1061.76	4.039
retake is going	1063.56	5.801
100% the way they came through Boba here	1065.80	7.561
just Fearless as it were as sedak says	1069.36	6.559
La just run right into B main the last	1073.36	4.439
time we saw that fight Sentinels was	1075.92	5.081
just Laing loud as they tried to come	1077.80	5.161
into B main they didn't even make it	1081.00	4.72
loud gained so much ground there	1082.96	4.44
completely taking Sentinels by surprise	1085.72	4.04
we set up for Sen in a bit of the same	1087.40	4.56
formation but less movement they're not	1089.76	3.72
taking as much of	1091.96	4.92
Market supressed the wall that they just	1093.48	5.199
dealt with there in B main usually can	1096.88	3.72
mean someone pushes up so you have to	1098.68	4.961
worry loud is giving send a lot of	1100.60	5.439
things to worry about here and with	1103.64	4.2
Dizzy down they're going to be able to	1106.04	3.961
have a little m in control but not sight	1107.84	5.839
yet s's just trying to play into loud's	1110.00	5.44
style where when they get pressure on	1113.68	3.401
one side they usually push the extremity	1115.44	3.16
on the other so you already see tens	1117.08	3.92
holding back towards the a main side all	1118.60	3.68
the way from Spawn trying to catch a	1121.00	3.159
forward push but nobody's really moving	1122.28	3.519
here from loud they held things back	1124.16	3.081
towards the B site they haven't really	1125.80	3.921
fully rotated and for them they're just	1127.24	4.2
very much still comfortable of playing	1129.72	4.52
that retake style uh towards this a sign	1131.44	4.28
for senal they regrouped after that	1134.24	3.16
after deniability that you saw there	1135.72	5.52
from less his utility with his	1137.40	7.24
teammates sen is looking to fit back	1141.24	5.76
toying with the door just hoping loud	1144.64	4.919
will have to keep covering Market there	1147.00	4.52
as they start to make their way zelus	1149.56	3.441
knife came up just a bit ago as they	1151.52	3.2
enter the a main area but this is a	1153.00	3.44
contact play they want to see how loud	1154.72	4.36
reacts to this and finally after the	1156.44	4.359
first SM comes out on the defense the	1159.08	3.0
other one goes out towards the spawn on	1160.80	3.521
the attack now you're not allowing here	1162.08	4.36
at twois to get the high stack and a	1164.32	4.8
spray with his Vandal which allows here	1166.44	6.92
a wingman to get a very Le plant towards	1169.12	4.24
a how far do they push forward little	1173.68	5.321
hide here from second right under the	1176.48	5.199
trash can John QD is going to be	1179.00	4.88
flanking far but it's watched by sedak	1181.68	4.161
What's the timing here loud comes	1183.88	3.4
through spawn through a whole flash	1185.84	2.68
towards the air just to try to slow it	1187.28	2.759
down for a bit just trying to take down	1188.52	3.32
Sak first to push towards that spawn it	1190.04	3.241
works out another one fell within the	1191.84	4.68
sight for loud loud have regain control	1193.28	5.12
of that b site the tap to flush out	1196.52	4.12
Sentinels once again double back towards	1198.40	4.04
the default box as last lines up two	1200.64	4.039
kills somehow and the spray comes back	1202.44	3.719
here through the cages but it's going to	1204.68	4.401
be difficult right now Sashi does get	1206.16	4.64
the pick the last one still sticks to	1209.08	2.92
the	1210.80	3.76
fuse not planed for them to be to play	1212.00	4.44
that push forward they really had to	1214.56	3.681
walk in the sight and L was always ready	1216.44	3.56
for that pretty wild damage from	1218.24	3.799
Sentinels though coming out with some	1220.00	5.6
pist on that round they drop all of loud	1222.04	5.161
loud and the fans happy though to pick	1225.60	3.04
up another round like we said even	1227.20	3.16
looking at five been showing up as well	1228.64	4.32
for Sentinels this season so we get back	1230.36	5.64
in also decided not to play the ascent	1232.96	5.48
in this Grand finals they didn't that	1236.00	5.6
the fact that we had ice box in here and	1238.44	4.76
S have been kind of kicking that out of	1241.60	3.28
the pool was very interesting I cannot	1243.20	5.599
wait but on Sunset until it does just	1244.88	6.799
that round 10 monster on the loose uhoh	1248.80	4.801
thrash right off the rip how does loud	1251.68	3.921
respond to an instant aggression tried	1253.60	4.72
to get a camera uh pivot towards the mid	1255.60	5.16
and zelus already fell now just spraying	1258.32	4.479
across here and gets a lucky kill onto a	1260.76	4.039
second that second that falls he's he	1262.80	4.801
get a plant now Hunter's Fury coming out	1264.80	4.961
from the defense of ping does get the	1267.60	4.84
hit onto John cue from	1269.76	5.159
qck as here's a shot from behind to lur	1272.44	5.04
once again Sashi gets it done TS under	1274.92	4.041
heavy pressure alone towards the back of	1277.48	3.64
the site thrash being picked up the TP	1278.96	3.88
away from one sees the second one and it	1281.12	2.84
does get the hit here that's going to	1282.84	3.8
delay even more sedak is detained tu's	1283.96	4.52
had to TP away and now they finally	1286.64	3.399
regroup they don't have too much utility	1288.48	3.199
but these smokes T is already pushing	1290.04	3.361
towards that spike a beautiful Dy	1291.68	4.24
allowing T to get that pick up to sedak	1293.40	5.32
alone a nice shot there from pens once	1295.92	5.76
again leading out for the kill and SEL	1298.72	4.439
finally get another point he threw that	1301.68	3.6
through the window right yep oh we	1303.16	4.4
hardly ever get to see the windows used	1305.28	4.64
awesome stuff from	1307.56	4.921
Market honestly little things like that	1309.92	4.281
you hardly see in your games are the	1312.48	3.48
ones that can catch you off guard in a	1314.20	5.079
millisecond oh my gosh	1315.96	5.48
one eny wait a minute yeah there's a	1319.28	6.321
window vent that TS vent s and that's	1321.44	6.88
going to be the end 64 the timeout pays	1325.60	5.6
off for Sentinels here big time after	1328.32	5.52
three post plant rounds successful in a	1331.20	6.28
row low seems the game plan got foiled	1333.84	5.319
but thankfully you still have players	1337.48	3.76
that could really think on their toes	1339.16	4.601
though with how tens and Sassy play that	1341.24	4.08
one because he lost a lot of players in	1343.76	2.84
the process trying to play this they're	1345.32	3.64
trying to play a contact towards the a	1346.60	5.52
sight gets dropped the L by from L you	1348.96	6.199
saw the Bucky TP towards the back Thea	1352.12	5.039
is there for the support still holding	1355.16	3.481
towards the back of the a site that hat	1357.16	3.601
is going to help a lot neural theft out	1358.64	3.919
it's a forward push here from Les	1360.76	3.72
outside the B site while the rest are	1362.56	4.161
pinged out all around the a site but for	1364.48	5.0
Sentinels it's a cut noise just want to	1366.72	4.36
reset for a bit here with a minute left	1369.48	4.799
on the clock I like the movement Les	1371.08	4.36
said all right we're getting pinged I'm	1374.28	2.601
going to get out here and kill the Trap	1375.44	3.359
it at B Main	1376.88	3.84
just to make John Cy think a little bit	1378.80	3.721
more so John always watching the flank	1380.72	4.52
though they have to watch for Less could	1382.52	4.519
be a fer in this round that just closes	1385.24	4.679
it out oh the Ang the whole time and now	1387.04	6.201
get all here comes the bom the M towards	1389.92	6.0
the back of the side contact on while	1393.24	4.72
the rest of the SEL were	1395.92	5.681
there just to get the driveby firing	1397.96	6.28
squad leaving Les	1401.60	5.559
alone yeah he broke one trip on the B	1404.24	4.84
site but couldn't get one on the a side	1407.16	4.4
so his cover is	1409.08	4.8
blown to keep away but that's Ace shot	1411.56	5.401
off and now no one else Peaks versus one	1413.88	5.32
holding a tight angle as set kin goes	1416.96	4.599
for the crabwalk though and he'll get	1419.20	6.64
the pick seven to four now last round	1421.56	8.12
Sentinels great control here kind of	1425.84	6.16
activating un loud so quick it almost	1429.68	3.88
look like loud fell asleep at the wheel	1432.00	3.52
for a second that's just the timing	1433.56	4.321
wasn't there Sentinels get a Thanos	1435.52	4.759
timing walking into elbow here Sai drops	1437.88	7.48
qck no flash and this what three a crowd	1440.28	7.201
that was so unlucky there for loud	1445.36	4.04
because they were anticipating that hit	1447.48	4.64
from SEL you saw who was I think it was	1449.40	4.92
C looking towards the a with a frenzy	1452.12	4.2
getting ready to hit that but hit both	1454.32	3.52
of his teammates even all three before	1456.32	3.839
but let's hold that thought Sher already	1457.84	4.68
out outside of the gates and blow Sedar	1460.16	3.561
to	1462.52	4.6
bits once again numbers Advantage for	1463.72	4.88
Sentinels Al allwing for them to work	1467.12	4.32
the map working back towards his BS side	1468.60	4.88
and right there I hope I have enough	1471.44	4.239
time to say this never mind not at all	1473.48	3.52
paranoia going back and forth just to	1475.68	3.521
try to delay towards the market but	1477.00	4.64
still allowing sentinals to gain space	1479.20	4.92
and a plant attempt as we went for	1481.64	3.919
attack first and lost players towards	1484.12	3.2
the market side sash is still alive at	1485.56	4.84
that spot though we try to hold it back	1487.32	5.839
finally successful for the	1490.40	5.361
sentinals smoke to just to help s a	1493.16	4.601
little bit towards the market L just	1495.76	3.56
winning here for that fight coming out	1497.76	4.88
from qck it's slow but it's coming as a	1499.32	4.76
dizzy comes up just to try to delay	1502.64	2.68
towards the back of the site even more	1504.08	3.04
finally that contact as you mentioned	1505.32	4.079
second season flates coming out there's	1507.12	4.76
that execution now for S back and forth	1509.40	4.52
but still the advantage for the attack	1511.88	4.76
side as they know it was that flanker	1513.92	4.921
qck with no utility after he uses his	1516.64	5.159
wall contact out to sasi allowing here a	1518.84	4.76
second just to wait for the tap pain	1521.80	3.721
shells to keep him at Bay that will	1523.60	3.24
definitely end the half right now	1525.52	2.8
especially with that	1526.84	3.92
coming out from Saia SS to close out the	1528.32	4.28
half with a four-point	1530.76	4.279
lead second us an ALT there at the	1532.60	4.439
beginning of the round the pressures	1535.04	4.481
created it's been such a different in	1537.04	4.24
that sense of ultimates being used right	1539.52	4.12
off the rip all of sck's hunters uh the	1541.28	4.161
hunters Furies came at the beginning of	1543.64	3.8
the round came to try and discombobulate	1545.44	4.119
what Sentinels was doing and they only	1547.44	4.32
had to slightly respect it cuz they can	1549.56	4.681
dodge it Z comes in you have to respect	1551.76	4.68
it the fundamental differences in the	1554.24	5.28
power that these comps can hit with is	1556.44	5.16
huge and we'll see that as loud comes on	1559.52	3.6
the attack side now it takes so much	1561.60	3.72
more to orchestrate this composition	1563.12	4.2
into a sight you definitely see a lot	1565.32	3.2
from all of these players right about	1567.32	3.68
that meta the battle of the igls the big	1568.52	4.56
brains from the coaching staff it's also	1571.00	3.64
just a heads sub play from all these	1573.08	3.76
players that has been looking so good in	1574.64	3.68
this first half and speaking of	1576.84	3.88
information to react right away a knife	1578.32	4.359
went out towards the as sign pinging a	1580.72	4.679
few here thrown by zelus and SEL knows	1582.68	4.48
as hits coming towards the aide and	1585.40	3.921
they're ready for this signature retake	1587.16	4.601
play style on the a site loud still	1589.32	4.28
deciding to work towards a though so	1591.76	3.21
they might have something back in	1593.60	3.679
[Applause]	1594.97	4.39
return what are we working with there	1597.28	3.681
are some ghosts so a little bit of a	1599.36	3.64
drop on util there classics will be able	1600.96	4.599
to come in full utility wise and the	1603.00	5.36
early delay early fakes with a bit of	1605.56	4.441
utility here I wonder if that's going to	1608.36	4.64
allow s in a bit more but this is louder	1610.00	4.32
hunger down here it's going to be hard	1613.00	3.08
to get them out parano and dizzy that's	1614.32	3.28
going to hit Fus runs inside the smoke	1616.08	4.24
the boom even SPS him and blows him away	1617.60	4.72
flash towards the back coward Z's fully	1620.32	3.88
blinded but is okay to stay behind the	1622.32	4.2
smoke attack onto the spike a FL line	1624.20	4.04
coming out a spray through the smoke a	1626.52	3.759
spray and pray and for L to hopefully	1628.24	4.08
get this pistol on their side it's not	1630.28	4.601
even halfway the oh the wingman already	1632.32	5.56
got fed but there's no time left there's	1634.88	6.82
no time left in front right clicks	1637.88	5.88
[Applause]	1641.70	4.62
what oh this is going to be the type of	1643.76	4.279
place that we're going to see in a p SM	1646.32	3.64
plays between loud and	1648.04	4.161
Sentinels we're going to be on Ed they	1649.96	4.719
they call that Cinema no just kidding	1652.20	4.959
that was the uh that was the Tuesday mat	1654.68	5.72
night that was absolute	1657.16	7.88
chaos oh my gosh did that's the I have	1660.40	7.241
one final Choice moment situations	1665.04	4.24
everybody's doing the final thing they	1667.64	3.759
know they're going to go down and that	1669.28	4.52
one was to jump through the smoke and	1671.40	3.921
finally kill the diffuser even though it	1673.80	2.681
probably wouldn't have been half that	1675.32	2.8
was just the kind of situation	1676.48	3.64
the pressure loud puts on the first	1678.12	3.64
attack round of their pistol here second	1680.12	3.36
half a big push here from Sentinels	1681.76	3.799
though this is going to be another War	1683.48	3.52
continuing with the double flash	1685.56	3.561
combination from the initiators but qck	1687.00	4.2
is just ready for that so that only does	1689.12	4.36
he stops to push from SEL but that's	1691.20	3.56
building up his ultimate here for the	1693.48	2.799
later rounds even trying to clear for	1694.76	3.44
more grabbing the or behind the all	1696.28	3.921
drone wouldn't be surprised if they just	1698.20	3.52
give him a plan or he just chases the	1700.20	3.599
kill but you're seeing like sentinals	1701.72	4.04
are trying to rework the map somewhere	1703.80	4.641
go head to-head Omen versus tues gets	1705.76	5.68
the upper hand of	1708.44	5.56
T actually did see qk trying to hunt for	1711.44	4.8
more kills there he got instantly Ned by	1714.00	4.559
sashy camera will let them know they can	1716.24	5.559
end at a on this one in loud I I feel	1718.56	5.84
like needed to start setting the pace as	1721.80	5.561
they got onto this attack side Sentinels	1724.40	5.12
as they were on attack like I said what	1727.36	4.08
didn't care when the hunters Fury came	1729.52	3.481
out from loud they were able to work	1731.44	4.28
around it absorb loud utility at market	1733.00	5.72
and hit a or the other way around A to B	1735.72	6.36
here loud cannot let Sentinel set up a	1738.72	5.439
defensive spot loud needs to be in their	1742.08	4.28
face all the time and again with this	1744.16	4.601
composition loud has that has to be	1746.36	4.52
everybody behind qck right qck is not	1748.76	4.639
blast packing in he's not dashing in	1750.88	4.24
Stand they have to go in together and	1753.40	3.12
right now they're picking these rounds	1755.12	3.96
up together yeah I mean as much as SEL	1756.52	4.28
has utility to retake these sights for	1759.08	3.439
alloud side they have as much s right	1760.80	2.921
they have the fault line to come out	1762.52	3.481
they have the over the smokes they have	1763.72	3.799
paranoia if they haven't used it forly	1766.00	3.72
takes it comes down to how they work the	1767.52	5.0
map once again here on the attack senel	1769.72	4.199
might have to try to change things a	1772.52	3.081
little bit here as they	1773.92	4.961
have a good round to come	1775.60	5.079
through that's for them to try to	1778.88	3.08
control something I wonder if they	1780.68	4.641
Sentinels try a trap play right away go	1781.96	4.839
for their own better guns than this with	1785.32	3.28
better guns than this	1786.80	4.72
yeah cuz it would be good against	1788.60	6.28
loud if if if loud were to go slow on	1791.52	5.801
around might be this thinking the low	1794.88	6.039
Low by is going to create a tough tough	1797.32	5.8
entry into the Sight Four towards a for	1800.92	4.201
loud heavy side as well for Sentinels	1803.12	4.52
strong side rather looks like up and	1805.12	4.24
over flash by Dizzy No they I don't	1807.64	4.24
think they've thrown anything yet heard	1809.36	3.96
a Flash coming out from zelus just to	1811.88	3.6
delay a bit though big paranoia fast	1813.32	4.88
again yeah boombod Z satchels away T's	1815.48	4.199
trying to swing back out just to try to	1818.20	3.64
catch Q off guard a knife is going to	1819.68	4.12
delay that utility that would allow for	1821.84	3.76
LA to gain that momentum gain that space	1823.80	4.081
that it gain towards the elbow SEL wants	1825.60	3.64
to fight back the aggression comes	1827.88	3.72
through Q still on the top a stier close	1829.24	5.24
range the celus for the classic H hands	1831.60	4.84
on the ground finally T takes him down	1834.48	4.079
and all the rest of loud Falls as twois	1836.44	4.839
was looking for that lurk and sels they	1838.56	4.72
fight back on the gun round they realize	1841.28	4.841
it's going to be chaos saner just as as	1843.28	4.721
hard and weird and fast right there as	1846.12	4.2
loud as trying to Hit That Elbow spot	1848.00	4.679
also take a little Pawn control and it	1850.32	4.76
is taking control to kind of organize	1852.68	4.281
this mess that's going on the nades that	1855.08	3.52
are being being thrown that first	1856.96	4.36
allowed this Long Peak to come through	1858.60	4.559
with qck there they knew they needed to	1861.32	4.359
get him out of the situation unroot him	1863.16	4.321
it just caused the push Sentinels is	1865.68	4.321
there numbers cuz they did choose the	1867.48	5.919
right sight expecting loud to hit a	1870.00	5.399
sometimes at some point those paint	1873.40	3.961
shells went down there from Zin and Q	1875.40	3.801
somehow still stood alive so you jump up	1877.36	4.319
on the box as fast as possible it's	1879.20	5.24
definitely difficult there for SEL are	1881.68	4.401
try to regain the elbow side but they	1884.44	3.959
did power numbers	1886.08	4.599
now we have a tech pause coming out here	1888.40	3.721
but it's quick you know didn't even have	1890.68	3.281
a chance to talk about it wow that's	1892.12	5.08
even better all right cool I'll take	1893.96	6.24
that any day now and just making sure	1897.20	5.319
Tech pause works right Tech pause the	1900.20	5.439
tech pause Le loud right now still has	1902.52	5.681
this run it back here that they could	1905.64	5.16
use they're adding that pressure on this	1908.20	5.56
a side to start even trying to see if	1910.80	4.6
there's going to be a push from s down	1913.76	4.159
towards the middle for a link control	1915.40	3.76
senel on their end though they're	1917.92	3.48
looking for once again the first Contact	1919.16	3.721
towards the front zel's with the support	1921.40	3.4
and the flashes on the back of the	1922.88	4.159
dumpster so they could fight back that's	1924.80	3.88
all they want to do so	1927.04	4.081
far when they spray it across they	1928.68	4.161
didn't hear anybody from loud shooting	1931.12	3.32
back so he might be able to start to	1932.84	3.4
Pivot back and work towards the side how	1934.44	3.28
about John cue it's the first time that	1936.24	3.439
we'll see loud start to use this wall	1937.72	3.6
here that kind of helps them get an	1939.68	4.72
entrance mostly for qck and and kenen to	1941.32	4.319
flash through then they can enter	1944.40	3.64
through their own wall and they have to	1945.64	4.561
make Sentinels worry thr comes flying	1948.04	4.12
out from sa to check mid control grabs	1950.20	5.079
one mark it Satchel still alive coming	1952.16	4.601
back but his teammate the Tain cannot	1955.28	4.321
really help get Mar comes down the Tom	1956.76	4.879
one celus gets the head shot T's ready	1959.60	4.64
for p Let's It Rip but the rest of loud	1961.64	3.88
made it through towards the Beast site	1964.24	3.12
nonetheless they gave up on that control	1965.52	3.321
towards the market the plant coming down	1967.36	3.919
here for cine hit by flashes all over	1968.84	4.88
faroud as sels are still out back on the	1971.28	4.601
outside by middle and B there's that	1973.72	6.12
fight to CAU it oh my God it all around	1975.88	6.0
leing now Les alone on the one versus	1979.84	5.439
four positioned now towards the Spike as	1981.88	5.88
at least the thrash is on spot him now	1985.28	4.441
back and forth we go and zelus gets	1987.76	5.32
another backstab 10 is ready to come out	1989.72	5.04
strong in his Grand finals as well it's	1993.08	5.4
been an incredible year for 10 so far we	1994.76	6.399
see him go from aggressive duelist over	1998.48	5.319
to smoke himself saying the consistency	2001.16	6.0
it brings to his play is unreal and	2003.80	4.961
looking at how that works if we think	2007.16	3.721
about t he's been on agents that can get	2008.76	4.0
out of a situation but you know where	2010.88	3.72
that Dash goes you know where he might	2012.76	4.72
be playing now he can reset on an omen	2014.60	5.679
he can he can audio cut and rat a little	2017.48	4.96
bit more he has so many more options	2020.28	4.721
here and he looks so happy to be playing	2022.44	4.68
the new role yeah it's insane too yeah	2025.00	3.679
the questions that came out of the t's	2027.12	3.72
role of like oh and he's not able to	2028.68	4.561
play a raise to on split or he should	2030.84	4.6
play a KO because it's it's like his	2033.24	4.12
play style from the other games but but	2035.44	4.56
this time as an omen he shining his	2037.36	5.799
stats this year on average on the yoru	2040.00	6.559
The Omen way better than his Jets Kos	2043.16	5.2
from last year kind of incredible that	2046.56	3.6
he's able to put up these numbers still	2048.36	3.56
you see how comfortable he is we're not	2050.16	3.48
over yet here three rounds way of	2051.92	3.361
getting the first M for SEL as louder	2053.64	3.72
looking for the contact play speaking of	2055.28	5.0
T he opens up the round Q Falls a tap on	2057.36	5.24
the spike Bing out the players of sels	2060.28	6.0
trying to push towards the spawn are L	2062.60	5.841
they will not any OPP which allows for	2066.28	3.48
them to at least get a plant down to	2068.44	4.479
build that economy for the	2069.76	3.159
next ready with the shorty in the	2073.36	6.76
Smoke St by keeps them at B but all of	2076.52	5.839
SEL are here getting ready to flood back	2080.12	5.04
from that a link once again and there he	2082.36	5.201
goes look at that utility everybody's	2085.16	4.081
hiding with within the smoke don't for	2087.56	4.0
allow sight the sight St off for kills	2089.24	4.879
and there's only less Ines left standing	2091.56	5.319
and Z himself is cleaning up the sight	2094.12	4.401
post offer ready for the next round as	2096.88	4.361
Sentinels score the	2098.52	5.8
11 it it kind of took Sentinels just	2101.24	6.56
fighting back as fast that I think the	2104.32	8.36
mid round where we saw Zen fly through	2107.80	7.36
that tells you how fast Sentinels want	2112.68	5.159
to be going right now and loud are going	2115.16	6.36
to be calling the timeout here boom T	2117.84	5.0
playing the	2121.52	4.68
smokes frags all around for the team is	2122.84	6.201
it's not just kind of the 3 utility	2126.20	4.28
that's being thrown on a defense for	2129.04	4.92
Sentinels they're also alone in these	2130.48	5.28
forward positions after they're not	2133.96	3.56
really able to set up for trades this	2135.76	2.92
time around	2137.52	3.68
though looks like loud is just holding	2138.68	5.8
back for a mid control	2141.20	3.28
MH their wait looks like this zero	2144.88	4.6
points going to come over the top you	2148.12	3.72
can see zelus is	2149.48	4.76
positioning and Loud get two caught in	2151.84	4.041
that looked purposeful as well they kind	2154.24	5.119
of stood exact where they wanted to so	2155.88	5.8
Viper and breach seeing on the right	2159.36	3.72
side of the map is what Sentinels is	2161.68	4.48
working with right now again this wall	2163.08	4.841
only two times since this wall was put	2166.16	3.32
up from loud have they tried to work	2167.92	3.919
through it last Market we saw Zen came	2169.48	4.72
flying through with a showstopper but	2171.84	5.201
now they're giving qck quite a task here	2174.20	4.44
yeah you already see qck working up the	2177.04	3.0
midd of the map the alone comes out	2178.64	3.12
toward three the right side but the	2180.04	3.24
important thing here is cine taking	2181.76	3.559
control of this be link they try to use	2183.28	3.48
this Rolling Thunder to hold towards the	2185.32	3.161
left side are flash towards the dumpster	2186.76	3.68
and instead after it sees nothing on the	2188.48	3.639
elbow side they regroup and try to go	2190.44	4.28
for the contact	2192.12	6.321
play looking at sadok sonar up drone has	2194.72	6.28
been used again they're really liking	2198.44	4.8
this elbow play at least putting three	2201.00	3.48
or four members in there they have to	2203.24	2.76
get kenzine in there because the fault	2204.48	3.04
lines from that side just seem so much	2206.00	4.2
more effective entry the Rolling Thunder	2207.52	5.64
yeah to boot right so having kenzen in	2210.20	4.84
this elbow has been a priority for loud	2213.16	3.52
they set it up again 30 seconds left	2215.04	3.92
it's going to be the 5v5 a good lurk	2216.68	4.56
here however from tuis could just	2218.96	5.04
separate sentinel's rotation feels like	2221.24	6.44
loud seeing here that senel like to play	2224.00	5.599
the retake just contacting a site	2227.68	4.04
allowing this utility to delay even more	2229.60	3.76
there it is and as he throws out the	2231.72	4.0
Rolling Thunder off the knife Q pushing	2233.36	4.441
forward just around the corner though	2235.72	4.76
zelus pulls out the N command Z holding	2237.80	4.76
all the way back towards That Boba sign	2240.48	3.72
where we have a late lurt from TU still	2242.56	3.84
waiting for that opportunity to strike	2244.20	4.32
back behind them but Sentinels are now	2246.40	4.24
running very quickly towards the a site	2248.52	4.0
show stopper to open it up it's Planet	2250.64	3.56
once again for the elbow spam wingman on	2252.52	3.96
the ground cine trying to delay as he	2254.20	4.879
runs forward with utility gets sedo on	2256.48	5.52
the other side there's that backstab to	2259.08	4.601
East trying to go for the hero play	2262.00	3.68
there's that first kill it's tapped at	2263.68	5.04
half there's no time 10 gets the kill	2265.68	5.639
but it's loud that stays alive Tu the	2268.72	6.56
ler King on that one absolutely pivotal	2271.32	6.161
that Tui stayed alive was able to get a	2275.28	5.64
huge kill on John QT there causing that	2277.48	5.2
defensive rotation to have to Route	2280.92	3.199
Around through spawn take a little bit	2282.68	4.8
more time everything that loud did there	2284.12	5.761
really hurt Sentinels sen tried to	2287.48	5.32
paranoia retake pawn shop into into the	2289.88	5.04
the dumpster there and it didn't really	2292.80	4.16
hit anybody they tried to retake flash	2294.92	4.32
on dumpster and all of what they needed	2296.96	5.159
for Sight was already used by the time	2299.24	5.4
Sentinels got there loud really draining	2302.12	5.641
Sentinels utility in a way they cannot	2304.64	5.199
retake see what happens here spread out	2307.76	4.319
across the map and a default same wall	2309.84	3.881
here loud's just kind of pressuring with	2312.08	4.201
this each round to give Sentinels to	2313.72	5.04
something uh to look at and then	2316.28	3.64
possibly play through it with their	2318.76	3.4
flashes saw two sets of footsteps there	2319.92	4.08
off that camera from John Q and look at	2322.16	3.88
SEL a flash over and a swing after a	2324.00	3.88
quad swing coming out and that's just	2326.04	3.559
being held back even paranoia to try to	2327.88	3.76
move forward C all the way back towards	2329.60	4.76
middle instead a spray through the blaze	2331.64	6.88
wall to get that kill on the market	2334.36	4.161
he's	2339.80	3.6
laughing oh that was that was a pretty	2340.60	5.081
hot	2343.40	2.28
situation as they pull back though with	2345.76	3.92
the numbers Advantage five players to	2347.80	4.279
work together towards the a site but SEL	2349.68	4.48
has the re on	2352.08	5.24
this never mind it's a double pump mhm	2354.16	5.28
cuz of the position all the way towards	2357.32	5.681
the B main okay so I feel like we have	2359.44	5.96
been missing this from loud in these few	2363.00	4.4
rounds the past round it would be that	2365.40	4.04
they tempted be main they were a little	2367.40	4.04
bit in mid right qck would flash and	2369.44	4.0
then everybody just reset to a default	2371.44	4.84
spot to hit a loud have not been leaving	2373.44	4.96
breadcrumbs around the map to be able to	2376.28	4.319
make audio calls on a rotation or be	2378.40	4.64
able to make that rotate and now we're	2380.60	3.881
seeing that come into play those	2383.04	4.079
audibles we know sadak for in the middle	2384.48	5.72
to late round zela he snuck through but	2387.12	5.041
KK was still holding towards the	2390.20	4.24
billboard of the B main a knife being	2392.16	3.64
thrown that would have been huge towards	2394.44	2.879
that b Main site where they don't have	2395.80	3.12
theault line Aftershock to work with or	2397.32	4.321
snake bights as a matter of fact even	2398.92	5.399
Q's re flanking towards the mids side	2401.64	4.439
but sel's already pushing forward	2404.32	3.52
spraying through the attacker smoke	2406.08	3.361
snake fight on the ground there's that	2407.84	4.401
backstab too good	2409.44	4.43
fork	2412.24	5.31
[Applause]	2413.87	3.68
wow what a swingy game a few rounds here	2417.60	7.041
a few rounds there but the the the way	2421.48	5.4
the rounds are swinging that team is in	2424.64	4.88
full	2426.88	2.64
control yeah that was close we see it	2430.68	6.88
again hey	2434.76	5.76
guy he's like I'm I'm not KO aled right	2437.56	5.12
now you can't do that I'm not going to	2440.52	6.16
be resed qck with a really nice FL use	2442.68	5.639
the alt on pulse plants instead of not	2446.68	3.0
having to waste them yes we heard some	2448.32	2.841
Hunters Fury but those were trap plays	2449.68	2.88
that they had on defense this time	2451.16	3.12
around though if they could continue to	2452.56	3.559
work the same way I mean for them they	2454.28	3.44
don't need to fix anything cuz they're	2456.12	3.641
coming back in this game percental the	2457.72	3.52
question is how do we want to fight this	2459.76	2.96
do we want to move more forward here to	2461.24	4.68
not allow L to play the contct it looks	2462.72	4.76
for information	2465.92	4.0
towards this	2467.48	5.16
midside fake TP to be M but the push is	2469.92	4.159
huge here from sen they're trying to	2472.64	3.08
change the pace of the game of what loud	2474.08	3.52
has been seeing the last few rounds	2475.72	4.879
feeling in control sen trying to take	2477.60	5.321
that away passive play from loud gets	2480.60	4.641
them safely across the map here but this	2482.92	4.0
is what they were doing before not	2485.24	3.48
really tempting or leaving anybody at a	2486.92	4.199
sight just making some noise mid and	2488.72	4.76
then they're going to hit a this could	2491.12	4.881
be basic things too from senel holding	2493.48	3.68
towards the back of the site with John's	2496.00	3.359
cuy set up on the a just to maybe try to	2497.16	4.64
break a windman with his trips inside	2499.36	5.76
the a site run it back here utilized by	2501.80	5.44
qck just to clear out the space towards	2505.12	5.281
the dumpster the plant still comes down	2507.24	6.32
a lucky kill up C throws up the hat but	2510.40	7.199
the plant still went down for loud	2513.56	6.16
that's huge that's Cen Z's the one they	2517.60	3.76
want an elbow for him to go down this	2519.72	3.8
means that s can get back in right now	2521.36	3.641
the goal is to protects to do so that he	2523.52	2.839
could use his Hunter's Fury there is	2525.00	3.76
that tap uses it out right away and now	2526.36	3.76
right after it's going to be allowed to	2528.76	3.12
fight back inside the smoke flashes are	2530.12	3.48
coming through nades are coming across	2531.88	4.28
towards the smokes as ten is holding off	2533.60	5.24
angle a curveball a nice Kill from T	2536.16	4.56
snake fights underground as well wingman	2538.84	3.76
comes up trying to get it down it's at	2540.72	3.96
least a halfway he's trying to stick it	2542.60	3.801
fully for wingman but gets the nine it's	2544.68	3.879
up to a two versus one a push for from	2546.40	5.08
blz once again the but John cuy as	2548.56	4.921
they'll get to the fuse in that point	2551.48	3.96
round 12 for	2553.48	4.96
Sentinels Match Point T again I'm pretty	2555.44	5.08
sure sidh show mentioned it previously	2558.44	4.399
but that flash turning percentage TS	2560.52	4.799
being at the top the least flashed	2562.84	5.201
member we see it in	2565.32	5.321
action and John cue that kill Flash and	2568.04	5.279
didn't care Oh still actually got tagged	2570.64	5.679
by it never mind good POV good POV it	2573.32	5.391
just doesn't matter with	2576.32	3.76
[Applause]	2578.71	3.77
tens he have a Cowen Zen that kill from	2580.08	4.641
John cuy on a Cowen Z you saw how	2582.48	4.119
confident Sentinels was to step forward	2584.72	4.96
there and go for the hit what a kill to	2586.60	5.681
be able to pull up sheris now for the	2589.68	5.2
side of loud what a hurt on game point	2592.28	5.279
now as they're going to try to get qck	2594.88	4.16
up this mid position again a little	2597.56	3.161
rinse and repeat on the strats before	2599.04	3.16
but it brings most to the team to keep	2600.72	4.16
him safe qy K with the sheriff the	2602.20	4.52
double swing out the wall Bang forcing	2604.88	4.16
zelus away trying to take the mid	2606.72	4.52
control even shock darts thrown from	2609.04	4.48
sadak to keep him back Sen's trying to	2611.24	3.8
push forward it was being watched by	2613.52	3.52
last so you have three players now	2615.04	5.16
contained in the a site that said though	2617.04	4.6
with the amount of rounds that were	2620.20	4.0
coming back there for loud that one	2621.64	4.959
single loss Now map point for Sentinels	2624.20	5.04
the econom is broken for loud have to	2626.60	4.52
try to get something done here	2629.24	4.079
controlling maybe an orb on the B site a	2631.12	5.641
Viper plant off the pit using his all	2633.32	6.24
drone to sell that fake with this is we	2636.76	4.76
got the back stab though for qk it's	2639.56	3.961
perfect but finally John comes out of	2641.52	3.839
the camera to trade that out they get	2643.52	3.48
information on that Sentinel player	2645.36	3.801
towards the back of the site and they	2647.00	5.119
try to execute now for	2649.16	6.0
Sentinels a tap to allow to swing out	2652.12	5.361
instant head shot seconds still not	2655.16	4.199
decided to go for the plant for Less	2657.48	3.599
they want to use it for cow Z's been a	2659.36	3.561
name of the game so far and how they're	2661.08	4.441
forming the ARs in the plant SEL now	2662.92	4.52
trying to go for a three- player retake	2665.52	3.64
at a	2667.44	3.639
disadvantage look how far back here	2669.16	3.959
sedak is still waiting to see somebody's	2671.08	3.801
going to flank across delays being	2673.12	4.361
thrown early for alloud a flash towards	2674.88	6.52
the market first Contact is less cine	2677.48	7.079
avoided the M pit now swings out hit by	2681.40	7.159
a least the fragment plant the n a push	2684.56	7.28
for it from twois zelis is alone and it	2688.56	6.8
becomes a nice pul plan hold for loud	2691.84	4.801
that	2695.36	3.521
actually is one of the coolest rounds	2696.64	4.64
I've seen Sadat come up with when they	2698.88	5.88
were running back to a you saw sedak	2701.28	5.0
instantly peel off it's like a light	2704.76	4.48
bulb went off in his head peels off and	2706.28	4.76
then sets up to quickly set the Drone it	2709.24	3.319
looked like they were actually running	2711.04	3.799
all the way back says okay Tu give me	2712.56	4.961
that Al back here they do a global	2714.84	6.081
distraction to allow qck K's hit to work	2717.52	7.12
even better sick thinking absolutely	2720.92	6.32
disgusting and we said just Sheriff just	2724.64	4.04
Sheriff it was the two first kills they	2727.24	2.319
got	2728.68	4.72
honestly Sheri making the crowd ill y	2729.56	7.081
making the crowd ill maybe	2733.40	7.56
again 9 to 12 pop flash towards mid	2736.64	7.64
possibly definitely satchels out from	2740.96	6.04
Zin a paranoia on top of that that came	2744.28	4.64
from 10 so try to do a trap play with	2747.00	4.079
the Lura that they have on the defense	2748.92	4.679
for Sentinels but again it's the master	2751.08	5.04
class IG and calls from sedak holding	2753.60	4.441
all the way back for toward spawn it's	2756.12	5.041
wild towards the extremities just wild	2758.04	5.84
all right into the side here just three	2761.16	5.919
rounds away for loud to secure us r	2763.88	6.239
o it's going to be a low buy from sen	2767.08	4.0
back in the sight they're going to	2770.12	2.72
hunker down and try to find those close	2771.08	5.401
angles it's how can loud dislodge them	2772.84	5.561
ultimate for Cowen Zen could come around	2776.48	3.599
that's the ultimate plant if they can	2778.40	4.36
keep cine then elbow without some John	2780.08	6.121
CU spam easy one there for zelus oo they	2782.76	4.599
lost the breadcrumb that's what they	2786.20	3.32
were leaving this time sedak goes down	2787.36	3.801
and they have to make noise now this is	2789.52	3.599
all going to be heard by T but T only	2791.16	4.04
has a sheriff in the back of the aite	2793.12	4.281
Sassi with a pistol himself so this is a	2795.20	4.6
very weak aite hold a flame coming	2797.40	3.959
behind here a flash tens is fully	2799.80	3.16
blinded the L comes up from the side	2801.36	5.641
from Les yeah s geta ding from Les three	2802.96	5.639
players remaining from C is coming back	2807.00	4.28
once again from the a link Che now takes	2808.60	4.321
control toward the back of the default	2811.28	3.44
gets one for his troubles back there a	2812.92	4.0
two versus two a pit out a rolling	2814.72	4.119
thunder giving a lot of chances for	2816.92	3.6
alloud here on the post plant camera	2818.84	4.121
coming out forcing now Sentinel to go	2820.52	5.16
inside the pit to fight back zelus at	2822.96	4.879
low on HP upgraded into a rifle they	2825.68	3.8
actually have two rifles to work with	2827.84	3.041
there's that first Anni ability to run	2829.48	3.639
across zelus does get the pick though	2830.88	4.719
and Les has one more s	2833.12	4.761
fight by him the tap on his [ __ ] the	2835.60	6.381
Kill from celus the F comes out for	2837.88	6.84
[Applause]	2841.98	5.74
s	2844.72	3.0
[Music]	2854.20	22.01
n	2874.72	29.92
[Music]	2876.21	31.23
n	2904.64	5.88
3K in one a 4K in the next like the CH	2907.44	4.56
like the Caster said at the time they	2910.52	3.48
just wanted to end that game it was over	2912.00	4.319
and he decided it I am so excited we get	2914.00	3.72
them back on split for the rematch	2916.32	3.201
though cuz they did test each other they	2917.72	3.72
pushed each other to the max Sentinels	2919.52	3.599
had things that could take sadak out of	2921.44	4.159
vent yada yada we get to see it all in	2923.12	5.0
play right now oh qck straight up to	2925.60	5.76
vent to start they are quick again no	2928.12	5.081
pun intended damn it you're trying	2931.36	3.24
you're trying trying to take control now	2933.20	3.56
towards the a tower it's a late split	2934.60	4.881
for loud as well you see both Les and	2936.76	5.319
Cen holding passively towards the a main	2939.48	4.68
see no pressure they can once again take	2942.08	4.161
control of a heaven and then maintaining	2944.16	3.919
a heaven control has been in of the game	2946.24	5.359
on this very map in this meta still a	2948.08	4.76
player holding towards the back of the	2951.60	3.361
site though zelus is hiding behind the	2952.84	4.361
map through two cages through a orb as	2954.96	4.04
think by gives his position away trying	2957.20	4.599
to look for a trap through this trip but	2959.00	4.799
it's cadine that breaks it runs through	2961.80	4.401
and scores first a one for one though as	2963.80	5.681
TZ is low on HP Spike finally going down	2966.20	5.919
asasi is on that flank on the a main Les	2969.48	4.639
has fallen so the control on the a	2972.12	3.72
heaven is going to be a little bit more	2974.12	4.521
difficult especially when two Falls	2975.84	4.401
giving an opportunity for senel to	2978.64	5.199
bombard utility NS and a flash trades	2980.24	6.359
off towards the back F line not able to	2983.84	5.72
come out as T swings from the elbow and	2986.60	5.2
Sentinels win a pistol Sentinels take	2989.56	4.481
the pistol a lot going on in that round	2991.80	4.481
loud very confident in their movement	2994.04	4.039
nice find to be able to get all the way	2996.28	4.0
through V towards a a heaven and	2998.08	4.441
waterfall in and then comes again the	3000.28	5.24
sen retake they gather together able to	3002.52	5.44
take out the sides extremities and	3005.52	4.16
basically everybody meets towards the	3007.96	3.119
top side of site for that flash from	3009.68	3.24
sashy to come in two from heav one	3011.08	5.121
screen but they are patient on that	3012.92	5.439
retake and a big play there as well	3016.20	4.48
Insight from zelus to be able to even	3018.36	4.561
deny those few seconds allow the B	3020.68	5.0
rotation to be a little bit closer so	3022.92	4.52
they are in position there it took them	3025.68	5.32
a bit to get zalis out of the site four	3027.44	6.76
or 14 here loud will slow work their	3031.00	5.28
wall up here towards the vent area I	3034.20	5.08
believe sashy says not so quick a six	3036.28	5.799
sense gets the pick that's a sky down	3039.28	4.44
for the attack but fall line pushes him	3042.08	4.161
away Les meanwhile did get an entry to	3043.72	4.879
trade it back towards the top of heaven	3046.24	4.24
so sash's in a tou spot but he's been	3048.60	4.321
good in this very spot before trying to	3050.48	4.44
isolate a 1 V one as Ken and his	3052.92	4.679
teammate push is in double shot and even	3054.92	4.12
a	3057.60	5.801
145 oh the sake fight good shots coming	3059.04	6.36
now but the utility is even better for	3063.40	4.76
SEL to answer right back that Spike down	3065.40	5.24
out in the open one versus three but	3068.16	5.199
tuis does have a sheriff zelus is low	3070.64	6.32
zekin is low this is duall sunset Deja	3073.36	7.24
Vu with that nade oh my word and really	3076.96	5.639
nicely done cuz I'm I'm sure John cue	3080.60	4.321
said someone is destroying my trips in B	3082.60	4.76
let's just hit whoever is in sight so	3084.92	5.159
those mollies and grenades a very high	3087.36	4.281
chance to be hitting their target and	3090.08	4.881
that they did but what can tuis do here	3091.64	5.64
two one shots and he has to connect with	3094.96	5.399
John cutie twice if it's not the head he	3097.28	5.16
had a lot of time to work a minute on	3100.36	3.641
the clock before he made it towards the	3102.44	3.0
line of scrimmage of the aite but a	3104.00	3.76
camera refresh for John cutie allowing	3105.44	3.84
for them to get ready for a triple swing	3107.76	3.76
on a contact Tu still looking to move	3109.28	4.319
forward 18 seconds left on the clock	3111.52	3.36
there's that contact there's oneon-one	3113.60	3.52
end y but was not ready for a second on	3114.88	4.719
the top of Heaven you see what these	3117.12	5.041
rounds mean though while there was the	3119.60	5.321
win there John we even wanted to wanted	3122.16	5.6
to drop those weapons and the win would	3124.92	4.879
have been the Big W S not letting it	3127.76	3.76
happen again though able to pick up that	3129.80	3.881
round still losing a few members though	3131.52	5.2
so not too bad loud still do some chip	3133.68	4.919
damage to that	3136.72	5.079
economy and now we'll see full Vandal bu	3138.60	5.321
across the board for them if they can	3141.80	4.641
start to take this	3143.92	4.6
wanting more saying just give me a few	3146.44	4.76
more few more they know they need it	3148.52	5.279
here again	3151.20	2.599
Sentinels which is surprising too that	3153.96	4.639
loud decid to pick the attack site first	3156.00	5.0
sel's very strong defensive halfs on	3158.60	5.441
this map screen down so now they have to	3161.00	4.76
try to work something getting a plant	3164.04	2.799
maybe would have helped them a little	3165.76	2.839
bit more in further rounds but at least	3166.84	3.48
they still have a gun round now third	3168.60	4.52
round on the board for split but T long	3170.32	6.161
range with a stinger Lees beams	3173.12	6.641
qck wow allows SEL to get the power play	3176.48	4.8
that was like oh there're still going to	3179.76	2.96
be I was going to say that's a trap play	3181.28	3.24
to Mid but it really only needed the the	3182.72	4.28
smoke to drop in tends to be there they	3184.52	4.319
were all ready to back him up though if	3187.00	4.319
it need be now the rotation back to a	3188.84	4.361
bit of a 3-2 yeah that's something that	3191.32	5.641
probably Bren would say they are T they	3193.20	6.599
are and they do I mean just pushing out	3196.96	4.159
with a stinger as well knowing you're	3199.80	3.681
going against the full by round didn't	3201.12	3.841
even phase him knows he can hit that	3203.48	3.24
head shot get the aim punch and finish	3204.96	4.92
it as it were paranoia still there if	3206.72	5.399
they want to play the retake more so and	3209.88	3.8
they are going to find a being a little	3212.12	3.361
Troublesome here as loud takes the sight	3213.68	3.879
he misses snake B so sasi has to fight	3215.48	4.16
alone fin L swings out doesn't care	3217.56	3.56
about being vulnerable that's a one for	3219.64	3.88
one but the advantage is still for sels	3221.12	4.24
less and twoes they've done this before	3223.52	4.0
at a disadvantage the first one to fall	3225.36	5.801
is sash almost gets that tap at one HP	3227.52	5.96
pain shells once again is it a touchdown	3231.16	4.159
but T doesn't care swings in for the the	3233.48	4.48
kills with the Stinger first and last	3235.32	5.681
two kills of this round asals win the	3237.96	6.2
bonus man T picking up you're not even	3241.00	4.359
you're not even going to say oh he's for	3244.16	3.48
the ultimate no tens is just heating up	3245.36	3.801
that's as good as having an ultimate all	3247.64	4.4
the time and he is cleaning up with that	3249.16	5.12
Stinger opening kill on the round final	3252.04	5.36
two kills on the round tens is let loose	3254.28	6.64
right now alow by again for loud here	3257.40	6.76
and they have not had a good time once	3260.92	5.24
they get to the site van silly it seems	3264.16	4.76
like loud needs to figure out a way	3266.16	5.04
again to start chip damaging Sentinels	3268.92	4.24
before they get to the site get this	3271.20	3.32
utility out of their hands cuz the	3273.16	4.28
retake is just too strong okay ramp	3274.52	6.96
control here for loud's try and pressure	3277.44	5.8
try and get Sentinels to move dislodge	3281.48	3.8
them from the original starting spots	3283.24	4.4
and coming up from the vent could get a	3285.28	5.0
kill here on to zelis her the drops as	3287.64	4.439
zelus goes back up there's a smoke for	3290.28	3.64
him to hide behind the Viper wall makes	3292.08	3.52
that out of safety so the time out but	3293.92	4.32
at least a stinger through two smokes	3295.60	5.48
puts zelus	3298.24	6.68
down that's crazy Vance Sentinels oh	3301.08	5.681
nice shot in the 10 yeah that's crazy	3304.92	4.8
Sentinels are losing players with a buy	3306.76	5.76
here from loud a lower buy that they	3309.72	4.359
have finally the anchor towards the back	3312.52	3.839
of the site swings for two sad looking	3314.08	5.52
to trade it out Q was	3316.36	6.281
there 2 looking for a timing made it	3319.60	4.401
through	3322.64	5.76
but C Falls a 2v2 40 seconds left on the	3324.00	6.319
clock spike is still up so they actually	3328.40	3.719
manage to take it back and move forward	3330.32	3.201
but John	3332.12	5.081
CU not loud to leave anywhere else as	3333.52	6.68
Rob Moore would say this kid can frag	3337.20	6.08
holy moly and he does calling the shots	3340.20	6.0
fragging the shots as well and the	3343.28	4.12
interesting thing I wanted to mention	3346.20	3.839
about that round Sentinels used that	3347.40	5.159
exact strategy to kill sadak when he had	3350.04	4.481
a judge and vent the last time they	3352.56	4.24
played so loud's like oh this Strat	3354.52	4.799
let's do it four up ramp one through mid	3356.80	5.28
zelis gets out and Sentinels still find	3359.32	4.121
a way to come up with the round even	3362.08	3.0
with a cheeky little trap play there	3363.44	3.879
from	3365.08	2.24
loud all	3369.32	5.52
right loud has been collecting these	3372.16	5.08
timeouts once they have this Rolling	3374.84	4.681
Thunder a bit a few ultimates to use	3377.24	3.799
here full ball for	3379.52	3.799
Sentinels yeah looking how things starts	3381.04	3.921
off though when we look at this rolling	3383.32	3.361
Thunder they not really trying to set	3384.96	3.76
something quick even spike is dropped	3386.68	3.399
trying to avoid flashes at the beginning	3388.72	2.16
of the	3390.08	3.121
round Wall comes up on the attack	3390.88	3.919
there's no answer for Sentinel so for	3393.20	3.32
Sentinel are they're staying quiet on	3394.80	3.56
their positions of where they're trying	3396.52	3.92
to hold the a site yeah they have	3398.36	3.841
options right they're keeping kawen in a	3400.44	3.639
nice fault line position they can go for	3402.20	4.119
ramp if they need to in a bit or they	3404.08	3.72
can go for something else we see that	3406.32	3.28
fault line coming back off a cool down	3407.80	3.961
so it wasn't an initial push from	3409.60	4.801
Sentinels giving safety here to both	3411.76	4.039
sadak and	3414.40	4.32
less so that's one Guiding Light one	3415.80	4.921
Trailblazer now used over towards the	3418.72	3.44
right side of this map I think this	3420.72	3.399
might activate your BS side a little	3422.16	3.12
start to walk	3424.12	3.841
in they get the cam and they press on on	3425.28	4.759
both ends so they actually didn't even	3427.96	4.079
break the cam yet for loud but it did	3430.04	3.361
smoke and actually the Trailblazer came	3432.04	3.0
up and that's actually quite crazy cuz	3433.40	3.12
not only the camera didn't break the	3435.04	3.241
Trailblazer did not break the trip but	3436.52	3.64
it got pinged out here by sedak as he	3438.28	3.759
dogged up so loud's going to have to be	3440.16	3.199
ready once to start hitting a sight if	3442.04	2.56
they want to split towards the a site	3443.36	3.041
through this Rolling Thunder just get	3444.60	3.76
ready so you can break this trip and not	3446.40	4.08
get sprayed by Z's position howder	3448.36	3.72
really trying to get the Seekers out	3450.48	4.8
right now in Sai is not given it here we	3452.08	4.401
go for the Rolling Thunder into the	3455.28	2.48
sight it's going to still be the retake	3456.48	2.0
from	3457.76	3.279
s The Flash in The Seekers does not	3458.48	5.48
allowed to get Q's kill on S but swings	3461.04	5.04
out still for that one second on the top	3463.96	4.44
of the a Heavens to drop two of his own	3466.08	3.881
spite let to get picked up once again	3468.40	4.56
nice shot by second to Second turning it	3469.96	4.96
around back in favor of loud and it's	3472.96	4.44
only zelus by himself first Contact	3474.92	4.56
against qck and there's that second	3477.40	4.24
swing from tuis not hunting down towards	3479.48	5.04
the side but loud defly instead of	3481.64	4.52
playing protocols just won the fight	3484.52	4.76
fight fight they had to at that point I	3486.16	5.76
mean as the clock runs down you don't	3489.28	4.559
get much more room to work you're going	3491.92	3.52
to have to go and you're going to have	3493.84	4.121
to accept that Seekers will find that	3495.44	6.159
out great push through flashed and	3497.96	6.52
denied by Seekers loud still getting the	3501.60	5.48
ground they need and are finally able to	3504.48	5.2
push forward out of the sight not allow	3507.08	4.28
send that setup that they've been	3509.68	4.48
getting unfortunate	3511.36	5.801
unfortunate four to one now loud feeling	3514.16	4.919
good though very fortunate for them	3517.16	4.32
ultimate for qck just one away here if	3519.08	4.76
they can focus an orb	3521.48	4.48
and definitely a light at the end of the	3523.84	4.121
tunnel to start grabbing more rounds	3525.96	4.56
obviously a buy here for Sen they had	3527.96	3.92
quite a bit of money to go through with	3530.52	3.4
those first four rounds this is a	3531.88	4.719
default we see go to a lot so set up in	3533.92	5.72
this 221 qck will now push up towards	3536.60	5.161
the vent sadok behind but they don't	3539.64	4.56
have time what a read here by Sentinels	3541.76	4.319
showstopper does not get any kills yet	3544.20	4.159
though you saw the idea out from loud	3546.08	3.52
but we hold that thought for a bit	3548.36	3.96
paranoia for allow to try to re-engage	3549.60	4.921
for control inside garage and finally as	3552.32	3.361
it slows down you could see it the	3554.52	3.0
trailer came out from sedak and he just	3555.68	3.919
waited at the corner with this dog up	3557.52	3.839
towards middle hoping to bait the show	3559.60	3.921
stoer out towards middle but then S	3561.36	2.841
okayy no we're going to take the	3563.52	2.64
extremity said and almost caught her few	3564.20	4.2
off that show	3566.16	4.6
stopper everybody trying to flip the	3568.40	5.439
timing right now sadak oh my gosh oh	3570.76	5.44
he's being watched three players are	3573.84	3.841
looking back they knew the orb was	3576.20	3.48
coming down sadak finally spotted and	3577.68	4.879
he's in heavy trouble yeah easy diggings	3579.68	5.52
here for Z as shooting anry towards the	3582.56	5.121
back of the site cage coming up get the	3585.20	3.56
hat	3587.68	3.679
out beat bossing around the map here as	3588.76	4.079
the rest of his team is able to clean it	3591.36	4.321
up from behind just Cypher walk around	3592.84	5.321
there trying to find his hat trying to	3595.68	5.32
find a body but he just could not he	3598.16	4.879
just couldn't find that no all right 5	3601.00	5.079
to one as we come up onto round seven Z	3603.04	6.241
92 and one I feel like there has been a	3606.08	5.121
lot of showstoppers out of Z in just	3609.28	4.839
this series pressuring it that one from	3611.20	5.52
loud really well absorbed understanding	3614.12	5.48
that would go into mid or or from B main	3616.72	5.0
they could rotate back around to Mid but	3619.60	4.161
Sentinels just seem to have the read	3621.72	4.8
after the initial again Z's been a	3623.76	4.079
nuisance towards the top of that a	3626.52	4.48
heaven side and Loud can't seem to	3627.84	5.28
really push him away from that spot and	3631.00	3.52
as they try to go for control towards	3633.12	3.761
the aamp this time a slight change of	3634.52	4.039
pace TS trying to play that aggressive	3636.88	3.439
position up towards the aamp doesn't	3638.56	4.361
even care about the satchels andus balls	3640.32	4.76
as	3642.92	2.159
well so you see sometimes it's	3645.28	3.64
aggressive from loud sometimes it's slow	3647.40	3.24
on the a ramp and even the positioning	3648.92	3.439
is well read from how Sentinels want to	3650.64	5.439
play seconds uh T and Z known for	3652.36	8.2
anchoring quite well on that a heaven	3656.08	4.48
side cover going now already loud	3660.80	5.52
working numbers down here Sentinels is	3664.00	5.24
not making anything easy for loud I	3666.32	5.681
think this is what we see from sen right	3669.24	5.599
if we had tens on bind they'd be pushing	3672.00	5.24
extremities everywhere the sen comp for	3674.84	4.801
split means they stay back they crowd	3677.24	4.76
together they retake together being able	3679.64	4.439
to flip Styles and identities like that	3682.00	5.28
I think Mak Sentinels so strong and hard	3684.08	4.96
for teams to read that aggression oh the	3687.28	6.4
trip across too easy down a saw the idea	3689.04	7.241
there and that L ler 30 seconds left not	3693.68	3.879
going to do too	3696.28	3.72
much okay at least that kill onto John	3697.56	5.121
cuy winning that fight rare moment there	3700.00	5.119
for the IG of Sentinel sign you	3702.68	5.52
definitely see here with 18 seconds	3705.12	5.841
left Phantom in	3708.20	5.28
hand just going to try to save it but	3710.96	4.28
the idea for loud was trying to go for	3713.48	4.76
just basic utility hit that aite the one	3715.24	4.96
pesky trip not breaking that utility	3718.24	4.319
from the John cue side on that a site	3720.20	5.52
allowing the anchor player of s so good	3722.56	6.121
back of sight flower pots yeah hell like	3725.72	4.839
he's so good uh in all of these rounds	3728.68	4.639
that we've seen Cal play their defensive	3730.56	4.8
side on split so far if we think back	3733.32	4.081
just to the the round Zack blasted into	3735.36	4.72
B main we were almost about to talk to	3737.40	4.84
about loud setting up their default	3740.08	4.0
again right partially through the round	3742.24	4.64
loud want to set up a default it's kind	3744.08	4.841
of telling to just look at that scenario	3746.88	4.52
and say Sentinels doesn't want loud to	3748.92	4.48
do default anything they're not giving	3751.40	4.24
loud time to default anything or get the	3753.40	4.919
benefit of defaulting anything they are	3755.64	5.159
really messing with how loud approaches	3758.32	4.76
the game here one of them is just	3760.80	4.161
staying back staying safe and making the	3763.08	4.161
retake that much stronger so loud try to	3764.96	4.159
put the game in their hands one of our	3767.24	4.599
first fast blast packs up here that was	3769.12	5.0
facilitated by Cen Zen's breach fault	3771.84	3.121
line	3774.12	2.881
staying alert staying safe and this time	3774.96	4.319
swing towards heaven even though you had	3777.00	4.64
the same type of conditioning that it's	3779.28	4.401
Zing out there outside that window of	3781.64	3.88
the aide this time it was 10 trying to	3783.68	3.2
hold it out but you saw the Crosshair	3785.52	3.599
placement from louds side instant entry	3786.88	5.239
and Advantage for the	3789.12	3.0
attack slow play denial delay right now	3792.84	6.801
coming in just so loud can't complete	3796.88	4.679
the strategy they want but they're also	3799.64	3.439
happy to see some of this util from	3801.56	3.841
Sentinels let in the power that they're	3803.08	3.881
going to have to deal with as they enter	3805.40	3.399
a site looks like it might be a commit	3806.96	4.839
to B no okay we see start trolling down	3808.80	5.28
the sewers and the rotation back	3811.80	4.601
overx they're definitely gambling this	3814.08	5.121
rotate back towards that b side Seekers	3816.40	4.52
coming out just to keep those players	3819.20	4.04
anchored inside be that's going to make	3820.92	4.439
it difficult for zelus couldn't find any	3823.24	4.319
surprise kills no trap coming across on	3825.36	3.401
his bside	3827.56	3.24
hold he going to say potentially they're	3828.76	3.359
going to try to save their weapons here	3830.80	3.52
but look at that rotate back from senal	3832.12	4.48
7 seconds left and zelus is trying to	3834.32	3.881
find a	3836.60	4.24
timing screen down this is it they crowd	3838.20	4.159
together all the power in one spot from	3840.84	2.72
screens they still have a dog and a	3842.36	2.361
flash so that's going to help them get	3843.56	3.56
information already preemptive utility	3844.72	5.559
used by loud for the P PL there is the O	3847.12	5.0
coming through forcing the dog to fall	3850.28	3.76
back there's that flash to swing out and	3852.12	3.561
Q gets the first pick that's definitely	3854.04	2.8
going to be for the	3855.68	3.8
last it's kind of like you first never	3856.84	5.641
mind we don't want any of that	3859.48	6.0
loud what a quick round by them but	3862.48	4.96
let's look at how they took it it is one	3865.48	4.639
of theirs a spray from Les that opens up	3867.44	4.96
that's a 5v4 that's legit another spray	3870.12	3.761
coming through the smoke isn't something	3872.40	3.84
you can replicate but the speed loud	3873.88	4.64
took on that round is what kind of gets	3876.24	5.2
Sentinels off kilter there loud can do	3878.52	5.0
that again so definitely seeing that	3881.44	4.52
speed is playing to their favor qck is	3883.52	4.559
going to have ultimate after this so off	3885.96	4.0
the rip we might get it again from loud	3888.08	3.72
and I think that's the way they should	3889.96	4.04
go and I I love that slight adjustment	3891.80	2.961
from	3894.00	3.079
a simple just push towards that window	3894.76	3.839
because when you're looking at where the	3897.08	3.601
anchor player towards the a side usually	3898.60	4.161
s is just waiting towards the back of	3900.68	3.48
the map playing behind the trip so you	3902.76	3.519
don't really have too much presence on	3904.16	3.959
screens or elbows so they just want to	3906.28	3.161
gamble it there when the Wall comes down	3908.12	2.761
for loud to get the pick and the gamble	3909.44	4.0
pays off of course Sentinels are you	3910.88	4.439
going to try to readjust on this and it	3913.44	3.48
starts off early I mean sashi's already	3915.32	3.24
at the entrance here looking to	3916.92	3.32
potentially flash for	3918.56	4.201
info as a knock comes out for the first	3920.24	4.16
time too and we talked about that that	3922.76	3.359
line of sight right and look at T	3924.40	3.28
instead of being towards the a heav he's	3926.12	3.641
oping out down the straight line from	3927.68	5.919
screens towards the entrance of that a	3929.76	3.839
sight there's a check making sure the	3934.76	3.96
Viper wall that just went up and down	3937.12	4.16
from Les did not provide any	3938.72	5.96
movement a 131 a lot of options for loud	3941.28	5.0
here they can actually call any audible	3944.68	3.919
they want a very flowing Strat to go	3946.28	5.161
through vent or B main here or uh male	3948.60	5.24
rather and male has a lot of utility	3951.44	3.839
look at get that show ster out for	3953.84	5.72
control Den run away gets two	3955.28	7.241
what it was like from the grave is	3959.56	6.04
insane what one straight bullet probably	3962.52	5.039
before he fell down seriously boom	3965.60	3.921
that's two down and already the pit out	3967.56	4.441
on the defense Doo loud is still trying	3969.52	4.599
to commit into this spike is still up on	3972.00	3.279
the back of	3974.12	3.761
sedak zel is holding behind here the	3975.28	5.121
double box trying to wrap around waiting	3977.88	5.399
for the tap of the spike fre players	3980.40	5.399
just trying to clear out the pit and it	3983.28	4.721
never checked that corner so everybody's	3985.80	3.48
dling down on	3988.00	3.839
HP now the plant comes down zela still	3989.28	4.881
holds it giving a chance here for SEL to	3991.84	4.401
across even the hat comes out there's	3994.16	4.04
that kill from zelus they spot the last	3996.24	3.52
two players the lurk is not even going	3998.20	4.24
to working last one now pinged out two	3999.76	4.64
East on the top of B Heaven The Flash	4002.44	4.679
the swing the diffuse is started and the	4004.40	6.199
kill comes in for John cutie 7 to2 a	4007.12	5.96
round you can chalk up to New Jersey	4010.60	6.161
finest oh oh what a double kill from	4013.08	7.601
Heaven Z season has been unreal right	4016.76	5.88
now they talked about him on the desk in	4020.68	4.399
between game one and two he has been	4022.64	5.159
putting off numbers but also you put him	4025.08	4.361
in situations where you should see a	4027.80	3.601
player going down with no kills he'll	4029.44	5.0
come up with too he'll come up with the	4031.40	7.52
unreal play and it's just wearing away	4034.44	6.599
loud that they can't get past this kind	4038.92	4.08
of stuff right now flick of the day	4041.04	3.76
flick of the day	4043.00	3.279
you bring it back for something like	4044.80	3.841
that honestly operator still there	4046.28	4.56
Sentinels feeling very much in control	4048.64	4.959
of this game receiving each one of loud	4050.84	5.401
strats so far so what is next tuis gets	4053.60	5.2
the op we got double Omen operator on	4056.24	4.839
the map right now less with the alt if	4058.80	4.76
they can gain ground into a sight and	4061.08	4.641
maybe even try to flex with it to put it	4063.56	5.04
down first that's rare too usually it's	4065.72	5.119
used on the defensive side for Q and	4068.60	5.881
twois makes that work though once again	4070.84	6.361
a high gamble that pays off for a power	4074.48	4.839
play for loud but they still have to go	4077.20	4.72
some through some yeah heavy heavy fire	4079.32	4.641
power of Sentinels here but Tes alone	4081.92	3.84
towards the Gite only has that op to	4083.96	3.8
work with a push down from zela so we're	4085.76	4.16
trying to go for again those one and	4087.76	5.2
duns hoping to get two hoping to get	4089.92	5.439
information as	4092.96	6.0
well I think he gets a mid lurk they go	4095.36	6.0
all the way around sloud is being very	4098.96	4.16
safe here I think zel's just turned so	4101.36	3.0
he might have heard him	4103.12	4.36
cross got that little step if they make	4104.36	5.0
any noise on ramp well no there you go	4107.48	4.56
allows T to inch out a little bit more	4109.36	4.96
get that pick Z to join him towards the	4112.04	4.44
back of the site there's a second and	4114.32	4.561
he's been good in this position as well	4116.48	4.08
parano on both ends not allowing the	4118.88	3.76
push forward a TP backwards as	4120.56	5.159
well but then finally kuki andless comes	4122.64	7.559
in they traded out two versus two zelus	4125.72	6.08
too far to throw the sake bites down to	4130.20	4.201
deny the plant John	4131.80	5.121
to meet up with as yes Les gets the AL	4134.40	4.68
out contr the elbow and both moving	4136.92	4.0
towards the screen that's a wild amount	4139.08	3.639
of ultimate right there pushed out a bit	4140.92	3.759
because of the column giving them much	4142.72	3.721
more room to play with	4144.68	4.441
here what all what do they have two they	4146.44	4.399
could viper bite elbow and try to make	4149.12	3.599
their way in watching just the entrance	4150.84	3.721
to sight from the uh top side here but	4152.72	3.841
that boom bot gives a clue here oh that	4154.56	3.639
players are coming across the wall bang	4156.56	4.0
after but the second one is nowhere to	4158.20	3.761
just sticking the spike right now and	4160.56	4.4
zelis will get	4161.96	5.719
theuse at the beginning of this map we	4164.96	6.16
said Sentinels somehow gets these	4167.68	6.721
Insight sticks on the defuse they take	4171.12	5.36
the site with members of the opposing	4174.40	4.439
team still alive to force them out of	4176.48	4.48
their position where they feel safe that	4178.84	5.36
was out of the ultimate and I think loud	4180.96	5.04
also predicted they might find some	4184.20	4.281
utility at elbow both Swing Out middle	4186.00	5.799
sight and that's all they wrot Sentinels	4188.48	5.679
stick to defuse again it's coming all	4191.80	5.801
too common and they get the round 8 to2	4194.16	6.56
now for Sentinels it's not the same	4197.60	5.4
comeback that Sunset had for loud that's	4200.72	4.081
for sure I feel that there's a moment of	4203.00	4.76
pressure there for L to on a 2v2 ouch	4204.80	6.08
hold though it's a beautiful fall once	4207.76	6.6
again using that theault line is	4210.88	6.08
Cosmetics two Falls for this heavy	4214.36	3.839
pressure that Lou is trying to get	4216.96	3.68
towards middle SEL are crunching back in	4218.20	4.561
looking to fight back sadak is stuck	4220.64	3.92
behind the boxes Satchel coming out	4222.76	5.12
celus with a jump kill doesn't care	4224.56	6.24
twerks away Sentinels is not allowing	4227.88	4.88
loud to play the game right now	4230.80	4.12
continuously pushing up finding their	4232.76	4.68
own fights pushing loud out of their own	4234.92	5.239
strategies constantly here to reset try	4237.44	5.759
again less mechanically gifted ready to	4240.16	5.0
open up on any members that Peak but	4243.20	4.601
Sentinels stay hunkered down trading	4245.16	4.401
each other ready on these hard angles	4247.80	3.6
look even all the way out of a at this	4249.56	3.639
point usually you have members anchored	4251.40	4.4
in sight but they're not giving loud any	4253.20	4.321
opportunities exactly they got active	4255.80	3.04
information the camera is watching	4257.52	2.8
everything from a and also towards	4258.84	2.76
heaven they just flash towards the	4260.32	4.04
garage as well coming out from Sashi so	4261.60	5.079
now the only the only positions that	4264.36	5.56
they could think of is 30 seconds V or	4266.68	5.04
rotate back towards a main holding	4269.92	3.759
outside of the radius of that camera	4271.72	3.48
it's not going to be easy for allow to	4273.68	3.601
take position so you already see it	4275.20	3.48
still anchoring up now towards the	4277.28	3.6
middle yeah this give up this round yeah	4278.68	3.921
save for sure knowing the ultimates are	4280.88	3.799
there Zin could easily just pop in seems	4282.60	5.119
like he has alts on rerun right now just	4284.68	5.121
more in his pocket once he uses	4287.72	4.96
it and go which and which sorry gives me	4289.80	4.12
an opportunity to talk a little bit	4292.68	2.801
about that pressure I was talking about	4293.92	3.92
and falling on those slight mistakes it	4295.48	4.8
was a 2v2 where they boom on outside of	4297.84	4.44
their own pit to give their positions	4300.28	3.76
away and that's something that they're	4302.28	2.959
going to have to clean up here if they	4304.04	3.119
want to play against a Sentinels that	4305.24	5.0
look so polished this kickoff in this	4307.16	7.681
year in this season of the BCT Americas	4310.24	7.121
I don't think we've really I we've seen	4314.84	4.48
it before but it's uncommon to see a	4317.36	3.68
team be able to play to their win	4319.32	3.56
condition so much and not have it	4321.04	4.08
affected really at all by their opponent	4322.88	3.96
if they're able to to switch something	4325.12	4.32
so slightly and it it keeps the flow	4326.84	5.0
going look at that that's Mance man	4329.44	5.08
getting a head scratch right there it's	4331.84	5.92
a cute cat all right there's some L for	4334.52	5.08
you as we get back into the game final	4337.76	3.64
round here can loud pick up a third one	4339.60	5.4
and save off a quick two rounds or three	4341.40	6.52
if sen can grab pistol the second half	4345.00	5.679
explod exactly a rare Fallout explosion	4347.92	3.799
towards the	4350.68	3.641
P senel just holding back using the	4351.72	4.52
camera looking to pressure up trap	4354.32	4.56
towards the male instead plant coming	4356.24	4.121
down for B	4358.88	5.6
main Seekers out as well instant retake	4360.36	6.68
attempt qck surprises one but second	4364.48	4.92
comes out with the CH stopper following	4367.04	5.119
The Seekers gets the N Les is out	4369.40	4.56
towards the pillar gets a pick look at	4372.16	3.841
that TP for the FL from as well things	4373.96	3.88
are looking good here for alloud on the	4376.00	3.88
post plant a high L stack now towards	4377.84	3.64
the dumpster paranoia and Flash coming	4379.88	3.24
through the high low is good for that	4381.48	3.44
first pick T looking to trade it back	4383.12	3.84
looking left and right through the the	4384.92	5.6
Viper or to get the pick but John cuy	4386.96	5.719
now in a clutch situation remember that	4390.52	4.44
TP I talked about before not even need	4392.68	4.841
it this time around cine winning his 1	4394.96	4.88
V1 allowing the half to finish N9 to	4397.52	5.04
three they finally get that third round	4399.84	6.28
and it again it is a huge one Sentinels	4402.56	7.159
had the read the whole time it took loud	4406.12	5.96
everything they had and the tank to get	4409.72	5.281
these rounds to hold the sight to get	4412.08	4.159
themselves the victory there and we	4415.00	3.04
could see just in the final rounds how	4416.24	4.721
Sentinels would make loud work for it	4418.04	5.92
over and over we're not seeing loud dive	4420.96	5.32
in off the back of qck and Sentinels	4423.96	4.92
know that qk isn't getting minivan so	4426.28	4.28
that I could see him play just like Z	4428.88	3.64
now but absolutely speaking of him 12	4430.56	4.4
and six so far the spray transfer that	4432.52	4.639
we saw that was sick on that first half	4434.96	3.6
when they were playing against the show	4437.16	4.241
stopper of Q on that opener Sentinels	4438.56	4.84
taking the lead Now by six taking the	4441.40	5.68
attack side of split where loud still	4443.40	5.92
also has a pretty decent split side on	4447.08	4.88
defense an opportunity to fight back and	4449.32	5.8
the fight starts for Mid control look at	4451.96	4.12
this	4455.12	3.559
wall louds put up the Sentinels will	4456.08	3.96
have to weave through a bit if they do	4458.68	3.601
want to take uh a b male	4460.04	4.76
control jump Peaks to come	4462.28	5.0
through sedak would love to save those	4464.80	3.64
guiding lights and	4467.28	3.84
Trailblazers yeah wins that wins that	4468.44	5.4
one rather qy K and sedak low on that HP	4471.12	5.2
and even senel resetting in the mid	4473.84	4.2
round pivoting towards this a side but	4476.32	3.2
still having a couple of players working	4478.04	3.679
towards B yeah smoke delay just came	4479.52	3.92
coming out of tuis there he's going to	4481.72	4.121
take a ramp control just for now and	4483.44	3.64
this is going to give loud the thought	4485.84	3.52
that they can rotate over towards that b	4487.08	4.88
side if if zelus can sell this okay the	4489.36	4.76
noise is already there from a	4491.96	4.199
yeah that Trailblazer comes up trying to	4494.12	3.84
find a timing as two spamming with his	4496.16	5.04
ghost through that smoke R cat reload	4497.96	5.52
yeah dog finds information towards be	4501.20	3.721
main but there's a beautiful flash	4503.48	4.159
double swing and look beautiful as a	4504.92	4.239
rotate for L looking for the pressure	4507.64	3.121
towards middle as well and we mentioned	4509.16	4.641
two lurkers on Sentinal side John Cy	4510.76	5.64
punishing that push from loud already a	4513.80	5.48
five on three as the Satchel comes in	4516.40	4.64
and will have a secured plant for	4519.28	5.919
Sentinels in the second pistol of split	4521.04	4.159
tough entry there you'll get sadok back	4526.28	5.68
over no utility to get back in this one	4528.84	4.12
so it's just going to be the three	4531.96	3.199
members to help with a fault line yeah	4532.96	5.719
five of Sentinels so a quick take by sen	4535.16	5.241
with a little bit of pressure around the	4538.68	3.681
map knowing what rotations might be	4540.40	4.08
coming through and just playing this	4542.36	3.56
wall a little bit and that small	4544.48	2.92
pressure that you mentioned that you	4545.92	3.2
mentioned rather towards that BS side	4547.40	4.16
kept SED do the whole round pretty much	4549.12	3.8
took a couple of seconds before he	4551.56	2.56
actually rotated back with the rest of	4552.92	3.4
the team to move in this aight for the	4554.12	3.72
attempt at the retake that will get	4556.32	4.28
fully denied by Sentinels only losing	4557.84	6.12
SAU in the process yep pulling those	4560.60	5.44
members to Anchor the site longer than	4563.96	4.4
they need to Sentinels seem to have such	4566.04	6.32
a read on what loud does right	4568.36	6.4
now see what happens the sheriff here	4572.36	4.48
for Les feeling pretty good with a bit	4574.76	4.12
of that money as we watch the	4576.84	4.92
replay combined	4578.88	6.0
retake get back into their Spike and	4581.76	5.68
Sentinels find that first round so loud	4584.88	4.799
did grab three it kind of takes the	4587.44	3.88
pressure off of losing that pistol but	4589.68	4.681
it never feels good to not get the start	4591.32	5.6
two bies going in for loud here trying	4594.36	3.839
to play it Coast to the chest and	4596.92	3.239
hopefully get some of these angles right	4598.20	3.601
on top of	4600.16	3.881
Sentinels they're going to work the wall	4601.80	3.8
still with a bit of hesitation on the	4604.04	2.96
left side of the map to see if loud	4605.60	4.0
wants to push you been pinging it out	4607.00	4.159
yeah that's going to be one of their big	4609.60	3.599
things coming into the into the gun	4611.16	4.441
rounds if loud cannot get extremity	4613.20	4.401
control this is where you start	4615.60	4.0
understanding the play style of loud L	4617.60	3.079
that they have they usually have	4619.60	2.84
shotguns to work with this time two bies	4620.68	3.681
for Cen to die so as soon as a fault	4622.44	4.0
line came out instant wall instant	4624.36	4.0
camera just to try to spot players	4626.44	3.96
running through and as nothing really	4628.36	4.56
happens to playing around this map	4630.40	4.68
around the a	4632.92	5.08
site it really kind of leaves kadine pin	4635.08	5.48
here in this position so then the	4638.00	4.6
pressure comes back towards Les the	4640.56	4.76
trail is now spots cow who goes for	4642.60	5.24
another fall line the long range	4645.32	6.48
connect takes down take down	4647.84	6.92
Z there is that bait allowing last to	4651.80	4.839
just swing out from the back of the map	4654.76	3.36
beautifully done for the crossfire set	4656.64	3.241
up for loud he was looking pretty good	4658.12	4.2
for C so far but somehow theoric play	4659.88	6.799
comes out 2v2 30 Q's only with pistols	4662.32	6.64
app PL for heaven both players still	4666.68	5.121
falling back in the back of the a site	4668.96	5.64
two flashes still available for still a	4671.80	4.72
pretty good position now for the attack	4674.60	4.2
pulse plant what a second round are they	4676.52	4.24
really going to steal this	4678.80	5.8
away not at this point no only just	4680.76	5.36
paranoia though might have an	4684.60	3.44
opportunity to isolate one but it's a	4686.12	3.64
double swing right after nice little	4688.04	3.72
bait here allowing to get the killing at	4689.76	4.52
least stopped the pressure that loud was	4691.76	4.36
almost converting there	4694.28	5.6
ony that got sketchy and Sentinels buys	4696.12	5.24
will still be pretty sketchy coming into	4699.88	4.0
this round due those frags from loud	4701.36	4.52
but it loud needs to start securing the	4703.88	4.92
rounds they're not really even able to	4705.88	5.6
cycle ALS like we see Sentinels doing on	4708.80	5.52
their round so the advantages aren't	4711.48	5.759
also coming from those factors it is	4714.32	4.8
just tough for loud to find a way in	4717.24	6.321
this gun round however could start that	4719.12	6.48
momentum I think it was ding all the	4723.56	3.72
games that Grandma Zin was talking about	4725.60	4.68
here the next second yeah I mean he was	4727.28	4.6
doing jump M before this too just	4730.28	2.64
getting the vibe getting his move	4731.88	3.52
movement down we know Z's movement is	4732.92	4.44
one of the Prime things he's known for	4735.40	5.04
so always doing that here he goes no	4737.36	7.279
satchels behind the The Flash though Zen	4740.44	5.64
couldn't get that kill but there is that	4744.64	4.841
sedak judge avoids it you saw the stun	4746.08	4.8
turning back so it's a fake to turn	4749.48	2.759
around and actually stun him to get the	4750.88	4.04
kill beautifully done by Sentinels two	4752.24	4.881
now out in the open second as across	4754.92	5.239
with his own judge opening up the Beast	4757.12	5.16
site a plant for main TS on the boxes	4760.16	4.281
looking towards to spawn there's only	4762.28	5.0
last so far as his other	4764.44	4.719
teammates feels like they're leaving him	4767.28	4.12
for dead there is still holding towards	4769.16	5.321
middle and a as T picks up the kill it's	4771.40	5.0
an absolute master class right now from	4774.48	4.4
Sentinels across these two maps looking	4776.40	4.36
they the way they took male let's just	4778.88	3.64
think about that the Trailblazer goes	4780.76	3.879
through and you think it's a vandal that	4782.52	4.04
would verse a judge but no T gets a	4784.64	3.481
guardian kill on the judge that's	4786.56	3.96
waiting that did not even get stunned	4788.12	5.599
like that is crazy the things you think	4790.52	5.6
should fall to the Wayside for Sen are	4793.72	4.52
going in their favor cuz they're all	4796.12	3.88
behind each other on these calls and	4798.24	3.92
they are making it work as a team an	4800.00	4.199
incredible team coming into the season	4802.16	4.601
important kills to save now for qck and	4804.20	5.201
gaad Zine where John CU is moving	4806.76	4.52
forward with his teammates putting the	4809.40	3.319
camera up spawning that raise and	4811.28	2.76
there's that pinch from the other side	4812.72	5.0
too at towards the ropes one to fall the	4814.04	5.48
second one stays alive so at least they	4817.72	3.201
kept the stronger weapon alive that's	4819.52	4.04
qck the dualist with the bandal	4820.92	3.92
but it's still map point though	4823.56	4.72
nonetheless for Sentinels map point with	4824.84	6.72
ice box in the mix	4828.28	7.6
next see this play once again just after	4831.56	7.079
talking about how Z is Vibe and his	4835.88	5.72
feeling it he gets a nice jumping drift	4838.64	4.761
in there into B site to open it up with	4841.60	4.16
the judge they have so many options so	4843.40	3.96
many variables I don't think we've	4845.76	4.0
really seen the same round from sen here	4847.36	4.799
on attack as they've been moving from	4849.76	5.479
that N9 three-core	4852.16	3.08
line hoping to get something done here	4855.48	5.4
with that Vandal from qck the force by	4857.72	4.801
of course coming through for loud so the	4860.88	3.4
two strongest weapons is two vandals to	4862.52	4.6
work with but it's spread thin here on	4864.28	3.6
the	4867.12	4.64
defense thin also on utility with 115	4867.88	6.04
left on the clock there's no paranoia	4871.76	5.12
only one flash left from sadak	4873.92	4.319
thankfully Kine is still there to	4876.88	3.04
support towards the a side with his own	4878.24	3.92
flashes and breach utility so all	4879.92	3.4
they're trying to right now on the	4882.16	3.361
inside is trying to delay with that util	4883.32	3.6
go for the crossfire set up on the top	4885.52	2.119
of	4886.92	3.759
mid it makes sense I mean use your fault	4887.64	4.321
line to get it back create an	4890.68	2.681
opportunity with it the first time they	4891.96	3.759
try to get a quick peek towards mid so	4893.36	4.52
Cowen Zen relying on that to be back and	4895.72	3.841
probably timing it just right that	4897.88	3.56
they'll have this a hold as they get	4899.56	3.88
over to the right side of the map it is	4901.44	3.6
going to be the lurk from Sassi this	4903.44	4.04
vent lurk again we keep seeing in the 14	4905.04	5.679
and it becomes such a big Kingpin for	4907.48	7.12
the round sassy fakes towards B main	4910.72	5.52
Seekers are out and they're going to	4914.60	3.72
start moving here 30 seconds left there	4916.24	5.0
it is oh absolutely ridiculous they're	4918.32	5.44
So Far Behind Enemy Lines loud doesn't	4921.24	4.601
even know just because of that pick that	4923.76	3.879
allows that pick to happen for a second	4925.84	4.28
on the as one was falling back now	4927.64	4.6
players are falling down towards the a	4930.12	5.28
side Cen alone Guardian cannot hold	4932.24	5.361
cannot hold the doors 10 seconds left	4935.40	5.36
there only one left two East B sight	4937.60	5.32
Guardian as well no flash as we	4940.76	4.6
mentioned Sentinels a full roster on the	4942.92	5.16
post plant it's looking like a done deal	4945.36	5.04
he's even walking the whole time they	4948.08	5.92
respected SEL so much on these lurks on	4950.40	6.839
these off these pul	4954.00	3.239
plants just going to probably look	4957.72	6.041
to Pat some stats up here there's that	4960.64	4.361
first	4963.76	4.84
one 10 low	4965.00	3.6
HP and there is that swing out finally	4969.32	8.16
getting the last pick sendal are one map	4973.00	7.679
away of winning the kickoff here in	4977.48	5.199
Americas some power they're looking to	4980.68	4.52
clear people in two shots so you expect	4982.68	5.921
those sheriffs to stay close hip to	4985.20	5.52
hip push up towards B they're going to	4988.60	4.24
get tens off of the site right	4990.72	4.96
away it's not only Sheriff but also a	4992.84	4.68
lot of ghosts	4995.68	3.881
now basically it's going to become a	4997.52	5.08
brawl oh he stays fundamentals and trade	4999.56	6.079
stay over all of them are bled t with	5002.60	6.079
three kills in the round last one to go	5005.64	5.52
finally denied by twois but he's all	5008.68	5.96
alone and second again the twinsies come	5011.16	5.761
out to work and the last thing loud	5014.64	4.08
wanted to see is a pistol round like	5016.92	3.64
that on map three from	5018.72	5.681
Sentinels absolutely incredible Outlaw	5020.56	8.24
coming in as well holy crap if tens felt	5024.40	6.279
like he was online in the other games	5028.80	4.56
this one just got turned turn on line as	5030.68	4.881
well how does he find these timings	5033.36	4.879
remember the last time with an op in the	5035.56	5.119
Smoke getting some kills on split shorty	5038.24	4.121
coming through this time getting a	5040.68	3.601
perfect timing for this flash to Blind	5042.36	4.08
everybody down on Lou side and get a	5044.28	3.64
three piece of his	5046.44	3.96
own he's going to be a force to be	5047.92	4.16
reckoned with right now on this	5050.40	4.0
map loud trying to change the pace	5052.08	4.88
aggressive now towards the aide sassy	5054.40	5.04
Falls quick pipe shot you see both of	5056.96	4.6
the walls over towards B quickly going	5059.44	3.84
up they're going to hit towards a so	5061.56	3.88
they try to draw attention and qck is	5063.28	3.52
going to pick another one up as second	5065.44	3.799
answers back yeah but then we have that	5066.80	4.439
ads from kaen picking up the Bulldog	5069.24	4.361
that was left behind Z and Falls so the	5071.24	4.201
outlaw will not be able to get picked up	5073.60	4.48
yet to allow these Pawn shots to happen	5075.44	4.679
you definitely do see L here one shot AV	5078.08	3.76
anything here with the outlaw or also	5080.12	3.841
just spamming with these rifles the	5081.84	6.52
submachine guns the Spectre to get the	5083.96	6.96
kill but after that first initial push	5088.36	5.319
coming out from John cue L seems to be	5090.92	4.199
in a very good position to hold this	5093.68	3.48
post	5095.12	6.12
plant slow push in back control the site	5097.16	5.361
they just trade whatever they're	5101.24	3.801
defending right now so loud can fire all	5102.52	5.159
the way in okay nice shot pushing	5105.04	4.599
forward to two versus one it's up to	5107.68	3.801
twois alone once again and that wall is	5109.64	3.08
going to be annoyed deal he gets the	5111.48	3.36
first kill s is trying to stick it but	5112.72	4.44
two is gets the pick the r b clutcher	5114.84	4.52
tie up the game early on ice box and	5117.16	5.681
Loud Comes Alive much earlier in this	5119.36	5.6
game it has to feel good for them to	5122.84	4.44
find ground right now the first two maps	5124.96	6.36
went 40 5 before loud answered back not	5127.28	4.839
this	5131.32	2.839
time we're going to see him a little bit	5132.12	3.801
more hungry here as we get into round	5134.16	4.601
three after this replay loud feeling	5135.92	7.0
good after the second round by to win	5138.76	6.84
after losing	5142.92	2.68
pistol still Smiles still vibing can	5146.40	6.96
never count loud out Cascade for forward	5149.80	5.28
still working this wall on to B but now	5153.36	3.279
they have Harbor's wall to take towards	5155.08	3.76
a as qck another first kill of the round	5156.64	4.401
time for SEL to push out quick and that	5158.84	5.0
Cask was annoying to deal with at least	5161.04	3.92
they got the kill out of that for	5163.84	2.799
Sentinels with the low bu that they have	5164.96	5.759
whole Classics actually just utility	5166.64	6.401
yeah really the plan was trying to get	5170.72	4.601
tens with orb a death allows for him to	5173.04	4.96
get the KO alt in the next round for	5175.32	5.04
loud it's a reset using utility now to	5178.00	5.08
clear towards the a site he throwing up	5180.36	4.56
a swing through the Viper wall beautiful	5183.08	4.4
Kill from c z Onin and once again	5184.92	5.16
nullifying the surprise attacks that SEL	5187.48	5.08
are trying to do little bit of Pop shots	5190.08	5.68
andly two gets the pick up the El's this	5192.56	5.36
lucking clean right now for loud's	5195.76	4.12
conversion off the Thrifty that they	5197.92	6.239
just got on round number two clean cut	5199.88	7.52
clear they take a sight they take down	5204.16	4.681
Sentinels for another round like you	5207.40	3.6
said Sentinels buying Classics seeing	5208.84	4.319
that a lot more from Team teams able to	5211.00	4.36
fill up the utility and it actually	5213.16	3.761
feels good because if you do go down	5215.36	3.24
with your classic you have utility	5216.92	4.12
coming into this round now so just get	5218.60	4.0
the dip into the pocket a little bit and	5221.04	2.92
you already have what you need to be	5222.60	3.32
throwing at your	5223.96	4.84
opponent utility and weapons for sure	5225.92	4.4
right right operator's going to be	5228.80	3.439
coming online here as we see Zack	5230.32	4.76
spending a little bit more still quite a	5232.24	5.841
few away from the ultimate on orbs so	5235.08	4.92
this op hopefully coming into play for	5238.08	4.72
them let see once loud figures out that	5240.00	4.639
might change their tune coming into this	5242.80	3.879
round but they are going to go for this	5244.64	4.441
pressure quickly on to Long be here D	5246.68	4.96
Miss so it allows John potentially get a	5249.08	4.559
surprise attack but just saw that jiggle	5251.64	4.841
peek out m l falls back in instantly one	5253.64	4.6
of those plays that L likes to do here	5256.48	4.679
is go aggressive instantly stop and try	5258.24	5.0
to Reit right after get into timing out	5261.16	4.681
for the defensive side alen drone gets	5263.24	4.361
denied not too much information but at	5265.84	3.16
least a reckoning comes out to clear out	5267.60	3.119
the site there's still players outside	5269.00	3.199
the perimeter though of this Reckoning	5270.72	4.041
on Cal side KO Al that we talked about	5272.20	4.96
before T has now activated it flash	5274.76	4.12
being thrown T falls down becomes a	5277.16	4.04
camera allowing John cuy to get these	5278.88	4.96
two picks now off the post plant there's	5281.20	4.641
a super late lur right now from Les two	5283.84	4.279
Snake Bites available wall is still up	5285.84	4.96
Cascade now being thrown exactly	5288.12	5.0
nullifying that but also allowing here T	5290.80	4.76
to come back up there is that res one	5293.12	4.321
flash that could be huge right now to	5295.56	4.0
use for both of the Defenders dizzy	5297.44	3.719
comes out tens gets ready to move	5299.56	3.04
forward John Q to get the pick on the	5301.16	3.881
twois the push for that flash allows	5302.60	4.84
zelus to get the pick Les becomes the	5305.04	5.56
last player standing also dropped by zel	5307.44	6.12
Asal will get a Flawless on diffuse once	5310.60	6.84
they got tens up reset they launched	5313.56	6.76
everything at yellow y we saw the	5317.44	4.48
entirety of loud back there double	5320.32	3.319
taking on which corner they wanted to	5321.92	3.44
peek at and then trying to dodge the	5323.64	3.801
mollies they were hitting around	5325.36	5.279
them incredible hit John cue finding two	5327.44	5.52
there was super big making the rest of	5330.64	4.52
this less pressured on the side of	5332.96	4.12
Sentinels as they retook also very nice	5335.16	3.48
to see as we talked about the Stop and	5337.08	3.76
Go that loud is doing that senel could	5338.64	3.881
also do that on their retakes hey the	5340.84	3.2
walls are blocking us let's just res	5342.52	3.36
tense and then we'll use more utility on	5344.04	4.639
the second wave so very well done good	5345.88	5.839
calls on the Fly here from the igl's as	5348.68	5.841
loud on sadak side is calling loud to	5351.72	4.52
try to push very aggressively behind the	5354.52	3.48
Cascade and trying to clear out the a	5356.24	4.161
site once again this KO from 10	5358.00	4.36
continues to nullify the utility the	5360.40	4.52
kazin's trying to bring allowing Zin to	5362.36	4.56
be posted up and get the first Blood	5364.92	4.719
against qck they couldn't clear a sight	5366.92	5.759
fully of the oper the Cascade forwards	5369.64	5.48
just waited out by Zen and then they	5372.68	5.841
fire back Cowen Zen able to trade now on	5375.12	6.961
to 10 oh oh utility the Marx goes on the	5378.52	6.32
ground bounces off bl's head who turns	5382.08	4.4
around says wait a minute with another	5384.84	3.76
kill there on to John C to even a third	5386.48	4.759
to dash away the quad denied by second	5388.60	6.72
but go is there for the trade one slight	5391.24	7.641
mistake and you saw how SEL just lost	5395.32	6.44
that round yeah Sentinels as well has	5398.88	5.759
been looking at a relatively timid	5401.76	6.2
timing from the loud Squad in all these	5404.64	5.241
maps and you almost see that there as	5407.96	3.64
sassi's ready to throw one and be like	5409.88	3.239
they're still coming into wait a minute	5411.60	3.84
they're in sight yeah that's the timing	5413.12	5.04
loud's trying to play right now right in	5415.44	6.16
your face awesome stuff loud turning the	5418.16	7.08
heat up cine now with the ultimate on	5421.60	5.76
the hunter Fury we saw this being used a	5425.24	4.44
lot on Lotus right off the rip to deter	5427.36	4.64
something that the defense was doing or	5429.68	3.921
the offense was	5432.00	3.96
doing and we'll see if it clears out the	5433.60	4.8
position of yellow or right under Nest	5435.96	3.8
where John cue was playing the other	5438.40	4.719
round he doubled up Focus towards B Les	5439.76	5.64
watching the rear here and Sentinels are	5443.12	4.761
playing little more timid after seeing	5445.40	4.36
loud's aggression on that last	5447.88	5.44
round you and scaling behind here the Y	5449.76	6.52
drone once again green control orb up	5453.32	5.28
for grabs M it seems as though we're	5456.28	4.52
trying to go for the quick yellow	5458.60	5.24
control John CD just waiting post it up	5460.80	4.2
for two of his teammates around the	5463.84	2.92
corner also watching flank under the	5465.00	4.48
tube viers pit up as they pick up the	5466.76	5.76
orb so they have it available for less	5469.48	5.92
there's a swing on both ends Nano swarm	5472.52	4.8
to the L A do from pushing forward and	5475.40	3.759
trying to get this plant down underand	5477.32	3.879
flash a swing out of that one blinds two	5479.16	4.881
t pick the kill plant then comes down	5481.20	4.321
instantly though zelus gets the kill	5484.04	2.28
onto	5485.52	4.04
sedak a two versus four disadvantage for	5486.32	5.44
loud those two ultimates are still	5489.56	3.88
available and he might try to delay as	5491.76	3.56
much as they can for coward Zen's hunted	5493.44	4.199
security to do some damage as that's one	5495.32	4.0
slight mistake there Le is able to	5497.64	4.201
punish it and that pit could be very	5499.32	4.319
detrimental for the retake of Sentinels	5501.84	3.6
snake bite on the ground wingman's	5503.64	4.441
trying to the fuse it so far less	5505.44	6.64
Falls and wingman gets to the fuse van	5508.08	6.119
Sly you mentioned something really	5512.08	4.36
awesome on the last round is that those	5514.20	4.96
the walls that we saw loud beat with	5516.44	4.6
using to encroach farther into the	5519.16	4.321
territory get to snowman push them off	5521.04	4.44
are being used by Sentinels to pick up	5523.48	4.36
their util and their members sash is	5525.48	4.32
able to throw a free dizzy recollect	5527.84	4.04
dizzy with the harbor Cascade or wall up	5529.80	4.48
whichever one was there and then they	5531.88	5.6
rehit the site again using loud's walls	5534.28	5.919
against them on this B retake we'll have	5537.48	5.0
to see how that get switched up	5540.20	4.161
pressure forward to not allow those	5542.48	4.239
walls to be so efficient for sels three	5544.36	4.799
ultimates here for loud we're back now	5546.72	4.321
to a tied one one of our closest to the	5549.16	4.881
series here as Sentinels ran away with	5551.04	5.48
the early rounds of the first few Maps	5554.04	4.199
does not see seem like loud to let that	5556.52	4.119
happen here a low bu on some members	5558.24	4.641
allow but still those ultimates are what	5560.64	4.641
they want to execute same type of play	5562.88	4.52
here just trying to have second give him	5565.28	5.399
an opportunity to get a op pick alen Jo	5567.40	5.759
knif comes out canel no information so	5570.68	3.841
we're going back and forth it seems like	5573.16	3.201
deja vu in round number	5574.52	4.719
seven will they be ready for Z posted at	5576.36	4.319
the same spot looking towards the pipes	5579.24	3.361
and yes they are cuz looks like La was	5580.68	4.56
trying to move down towards 410 instead	5582.60	4.599
SAS ready to greet them though pushing	5585.24	3.88
forward s gets that pick AR going to	5587.20	3.721
trade it off less with the lur that they	5589.12	3.08
mentioned on the desk but he gets	5590.92	3.36
spotted by the turret and zelis is going	5592.20	4.44
to be on a One V one in that section	5594.28	3.879
meanwhile though able to get the lock	5596.64	3.681
down up on the attack which will	5598.16	5.0
potentially allow l to move in and get a	5600.32	5.68
plant thrash already used on this great	5603.16	5.48
job by loud to avoid that and be able to	5606.00	5.28
kind of skirt around that ultimate of	5608.64	4.681
sashy here now Sentinels with the retake	5611.28	4.72
loud they are ready the knife is in the	5613.32	4.28
back of the site does not spot anybody	5616.00	3.48
so SEL could start working forward of	5617.60	4.16
the site a tradeoff that happens back	5619.48	4.48
and forth two again in a clutch	5621.76	4.959
situation against John C ints tap on the	5623.96	5.08
spike it's not really for him no so he	5626.72	3.761
has to lurk up and that high tide is	5629.04	4.76
going to be annoy but it was T gets the	5630.48	7.239
r ACR and wins that	5633.80	9.08
fight IG coming up strong again John cue	5637.72	6.721
these situations that you put him in you	5642.88	4.239
see him coming out on top quite a bit	5644.44	4.36
and for a pressure to be on a new player	5647.12	3.52
it does not seem like it affects him all	5648.80	3.359
that much grabs the operator they're	5650.64	2.801
going to have that going into the next	5652.16	3.161
round as that's been traded back and	5653.44	3.64
forth a little bit	5655.32	4.52
here you should run as we see this play	5657.08	4.92
right through window from Spawn picking	5659.84	4.6
up the first	5662.00	5.28
one and just having to dislodge the rest	5664.44	5.16
of loud out of the sight	5667.28	5.919
here crazy to be able to come in 3v2	5669.60	5.68
easily taking down the members there	5673.20	3.641
John cutie for the 1 V one now	5675.28	3.52
ultimate's ready for him zelis has the	5676.84	4.64
retake so they can ensure this to be a	5678.80	5.28
next round if they get that retake going	5681.48	4.48
just right we look at the side aloud	5684.08	3.96
they're going to call the timeout hun	5685.96	4.88
Fury is still there for cenen you have	5688.04	5.76
Bladestorm now coming up for qck what's	5690.84	5.64
the effect because we know the loud comp	5693.80	6.28
isn't using qck as OS was used right	5696.48	5.32
it's more flexible they can do what they	5700.08	3.44
want but also if they want him to	5701.80	3.8
aggress they can how do they give him	5703.52	3.719
that space though with this composition	5705.60	3.039
you don't you're not really throwing	5707.24	3.121
flashes over a wall you're not doing too	5708.64	3.721
much not flashing anybody to be honest	5710.36	3.359
you're just breaking crosshairs and	5712.36	3.6
technically for loud so far on their	5713.72	4.44
attack they can't do whatever they want	5715.96	3.719
because again when it comes down to the	5718.16	5.121
initiator battle between cow rather ands	5719.68	6.361
that knife denies so much information	5723.28	5.2
for L to really try to gain that space	5726.04	4.159
to move together or even get some pings	5728.48	4.36
out so senel so far on the initial hits	5730.20	4.401
coming out from L they could always stay	5732.84	4.359
posted up really yeah and you continue	5734.60	4.48
with the same great protocols that they	5737.20	3.44
have on the retakes I mean they've got	5739.08	3.92
four diffuses uh three diffuses so far	5740.64	4.201
in the four rounds that they won loud	5743.00	3.04
had to figure out a way to hold the	5744.84	3.48
pulse	5746.04	2.28
plant all right	5749.64	6.6
scattered low armor across both	5752.84	5.96
teams trying to get an upper operator	5756.24	4.4
shot here just to start off the round on	5758.80	4.399
some high lows very big pick from Zack	5760.64	4.801
and he's going to stay yeah he's got	5763.20	3.761
support there dizy to try to get more	5765.44	3.08
information instead there's a second	5766.96	3.719
jump CLA is coming through so they know	5768.52	4.0
the pressure is coming in towards loud	5770.68	3.761
but look at that instant pivot two	5772.52	3.4
players now pushing forward towards the	5774.44	3.679
aite to rotate coming across as well orb	5775.92	3.68
which should soon be coming up towards	5778.12	3.961
middle here to allow for them to CR	5779.60	4.92
meanwhile the same good old thing this	5782.08	5.68
time not being sadak because it's C Ona	5784.52	4.599
using the AL drone to bait out the	5787.76	3.439
players of SEL out towards this B sign	5789.12	4.241
and they walk slowly towards a full	5791.20	4.681
retake set up now for that side all loud	5793.36	4.48
has to deal with is the ultimate or	5795.88	4.6
sorry utility from zelis and that's just	5797.84	4.92
delay denial probably won't come up with	5800.48	3.8
too much they'll be able to wait this	5802.76	3.439
out and the Reckoning gives lets them	5804.28	5.2
know this space is free qk and goes even	5806.20	7.52
further got Hunter Fury want to unless Q	5809.48	7.04
could do something Ash is so out of	5813.72	5.52
position not going to be able to use it	5816.52	4.48
he going to be in a one and done for qck	5819.24	3.521
gets a pick at least before he gets	5821.00	4.159
traded out by z a four versus four	5822.76	3.68
trying to use the hunter Fury for the	5825.16	3.321
pul SP instead Zin gets the pick up the	5826.44	4.12
qck as Nanos storms are now trying to	5828.48	3.92
delay here on the attack side there's	5830.56	3.88
that Recon D coming through K rips out	5832.40	4.2
the hted fury but nobody's on the spike	5834.44	4.719
so far just a tap to actually bait out	5836.60	4.24
the alt here it comes the wingman to	5839.16	3.441
come out the start the theuse SOS are	5840.84	4.12
fighting for in front of the wall but	5842.60	4.079
the shot darts are coming out denies the	5844.96	2.8
wingman	5846.68	4.281
defuse couple kills coming across though	5847.76	4.879
are holding the ground s butt on the	5850.96	4.48
ground and there's no time left SAS on a	5852.64	4.761
one versus two hoping to make it	5855.44	3.44
expensive at least on the exit they're	5857.40	3.96
both ran out of ammo but both still die	5858.88	5.08
from the spike loud tie up the game four	5861.36	6.48
to four beautiful chaos of a round oh my	5863.96	6.92
gosh at one point John cue grabbed down	5867.84	6.08
to the rope to block wingman he was just	5870.88	4.64
sitting there holding on to the Rope	5873.92	4.12
spraying off of it that's crazy	5875.52	4.199
everybody just trying to body block	5878.04	3.52
there they're still able to get the U	5879.72	4.4
the viper bite actually coming up huge	5881.56	4.8
to cause the vulnerable there and uh	5884.12	3.801
little handshake to end the round high	5886.36	4.44
five between those two four to four now	5887.92	5.719
these rounds are getting chaotic this is	5890.80	5.68
awesome and see how the players are just	5893.64	4.96
kind of regaining control of what's been	5896.48	5.0
happening in sight we start this one off	5898.60	4.761
again the focus from loud starts with	5901.48	4.759
this B hit they tempt it they Cascade go	5903.36	5.08
with the Drone and see what they can get	5906.24	3.721
out of a fight here cuz Sentinels	5908.44	3.08
they've been given that Peak tens will	5909.96	3.48
be there or second they're trying to get	5911.52	3.639
a first kill that type of round reminds	5913.44	3.56
me of pearl all over again trying to	5915.16	3.48
play controller the PO Planet	5917.00	3.28
everybody's playing lineups and sprays	5918.64	3.721
through smokes you're just crossing your	5920.28	3.72
fingers to actually get the diffuser	5922.36	4.56
just need some Odin exactly start least	5924.00	4.36
it's been working for both teams	5926.92	2.64
sometimes you win some sometimes you	5928.36	2.48
lose some but it's a clean slate in	5929.56	3.8
round number nine four to four our score	5930.84	6.359
line sadak trying to push forward off an	5933.36	6.279
orb coming down on the defense TS only	5937.20	5.4
Shar alone underhand flash information	5939.64	4.761
but cine they were ready for that this	5942.60	4.841
time around cine and less all comes out	5944.40	6.12
denial attempt of a plant but Sak still	5947.44	5.44
is able to put it	5950.52	5.52
down wow loudest thing so much farther	5952.88	6.12
forward staying too yellow still pushing	5956.04	5.52
out from long nice UIL kill	5959.00	4.56
zelis is just dancing and dodging in	5961.56	4.44
there Nice kill by Kine who gets a third	5963.56	4.44
in the round even sedak I mean the traes	5966.00	5.199
are nice the positions great it does	5968.00	5.32
allow J Q to get anything done inside of	5971.20	4.44
his own pit so he's going to let that	5973.32	4.08
pit evaporate so he could save his	5975.64	4.841
weapon but loud able to fight back and	5977.40	4.56
take the lead now it's been a while	5980.48	3.32
since we've seen loud having some sort	5981.96	4.56
of commanding lead yeah Teamworks on	5983.80	4.52
point for loud here like we said this	5986.52	3.599
this composition doesn't just have one	5988.32	4.0
dashing in with free space being given	5990.12	4.441
by flashes and a bunch of utility it	5992.32	4.76
requires loud to be behind each other it	5994.56	4.639
takes a lot more to get this composition	5997.08	4.72
to work that loud is using you got to	5999.20	5.281
remember that very easy for Sentinels to	6001.80	4.64
pick apart the Gap close if they can't	6004.48	4.159
reach QC on the dash right he's left out	6006.44	5.52
on an island everything loud does has to	6008.64	5.96
be in sync and here they collect a	6011.96	5.04
really nice round at B they get the	6014.60	4.401
ultimate out of John Cy as well so they	6017.00	3.639
have to deal with less going into this	6019.00	4.36
round not their own teammate but five to	6020.64	7.361
four 10 round 10 rather pretty good buy	6023.36	7.0
here for loud to be looking at low armor	6028.00	5.28
by for the Sentinel	6030.36	6.6
side low armor by pushing exactly	6033.28	6.399
looking for aggression staying outside	6036.96	5.08
of the range of the Dizzy something that	6039.68	4.841
also EG struggle to taking control of	6042.04	5.52
green nonetheless loud scores First	6044.52	5.36
Advantage as zelus is under heavy heavy	6047.56	3.599
pressure forc the fall back back in the	6049.88	3.0
back of the sight M moving forward to	6051.16	3.921
the way as s gets two looks back at the	6052.88	3.88
top of the 41 as two takes him down	6055.08	3.44
though still the advantage comes out the	6056.76	3.879
orb for a plant on the top of the a	6058.52	3.8
tower coming out from	6060.64	4.361
Loud N come in available for T if they	6062.32	5.16
want to try to retake this one but it	6065.00	4.36
comes down to if they can get these	6067.48	4.84
picks and they cannot Tu looking clean	6069.36	5.68
on those two tu's toying with them here	6072.32	5.96
and look at Reckoning up again we just	6075.04	6.28
saw that clear a sight for loud into a	6078.28	4.56
this is what we saw from Z in the	6081.32	3.319
previous maps of just raise Al after	6082.84	4.799
raise Al loud is collecting those alt	6084.64	5.361
they're collecting s's head right now	6087.64	5.441
and they want this fourth map real bad	6090.00	5.92
three ultimates to be used is Saucy does	6093.08	5.119
that work but it was the work around	6095.92	3.96
still enough control over the site here	6098.20	4.92
for loud to be able to to control it	6099.88	5.279
okay I don't know if it would go	6103.12	5.12
in where are we going towards a again	6105.16	6.801
Reckoning held and ready	6108.24	4.841
BL storm	6111.96	3.04
available bumping into each other	6113.08	3.599
getting concussed by the Reckoning a	6115.00	2.76
ping coming	6116.68	4.081
out Z's able to dodge it though so that	6117.76	4.72
does no damage at all second dashing	6120.76	3.16
forward looking to reposition on the top	6122.48	3.679
of the a tower Q with the opener there's	6123.92	4.36
that pick but instantly traded out sadak	6126.16	3.641
on the top and they tried to do the null	6128.28	4.04
command on the Sentinel side but as they	6129.80	4.399
were doing a lot of noise for loud they	6132.32	3.68
stay back towards the site and just	6134.20	4.081
picked out sels on the retake trying to	6136.00	3.76
be a little bit more proactive and	6138.28	3.72
aggressive against loud	6139.76	5.479
he last with one John ctie here to try	6142.00	4.679
and clean up three it's going to be	6145.24	4.44
tough I love the choice these Final	6146.68	5.761
Shots come through you might look at Cen	6149.68	5.161
Zen's Hunter Hunter Fury and say why go	6152.44	4.6
after the jet why go after Zen well	6154.84	3.839
you're keeping the blad Storm Out of	6157.04	3.52
Sight he may updraft he may do a bunch	6158.68	3.96
of stuff to dodge it but your team has	6160.56	4.639
freedom from the Jets ultimate they just	6162.64	4.921
focused on orb to get that sight they	6165.20	4.44
don't have to deal it with an up drop	6167.56	4.32
they just focus	6169.64	4.201
for these type of kills that's an easy	6171.88	4.0
one why you all in the jet I'm not going	6173.84	4.879
to explain it but no great play there by	6175.88	4.799
Cowen Zen to actually take Ze out of the	6178.72	5.241
mix really heady stuff there very happy	6180.68	5.44
you see loud still vibing even when they	6183.96	3.88
were down they had the same Smiles on	6186.12	3.52
and they have to be feeling even better	6187.84	3.72
now van silly Final Round Here of the	6189.64	4.761
first half on map three loud comes back	6191.56	5.8
to take their first half possibly 8 to	6194.40	5.16
four we see the spike down so this is	6197.36	4.0
going to be a weighted out round they're	6199.56	3.639
seeing again if Sentinels will give them	6201.36	3.839
that Peak at yellow just to get that	6203.20	4.44
first fight L carrying the op in mid and	6205.20	3.641
finally Sentinels are able to take	6207.64	3.48
control of the aside pressure so you see	6208.84	4.48
how zelus and Zin are currently posted	6211.12	4.04
watching belt watching main so they know	6213.32	3.44
now that the hits coming towards the	6215.16	4.121
bite at least to start the early call	6216.76	5.0
from loud to take control of yellow as	6219.28	4.64
you mentioned here ri at the same time	6221.76	3.879
important to keep sasi alive cuz he has	6223.92	3.44
a thrash to work with there's the	6225.64	3.52
commitment now for allow for the first	6227.36	3.56
initial hit but they haven't really	6229.16	4.641
cross the line to try to tap a [ __ ] and	6230.92	6.239
try to waste that utility out	6233.80	3.359
first I'm going to stick this they're	6237.92	4.36
using a different wall now for Harbor	6240.40	3.799
they're not allowing those sections to	6242.28	4.64
be created as much as Sentinels retake	6244.20	5.04
this wall is covering mid and snowman	6246.92	4.56
entrance now straight across instead of	6249.24	4.88
diagonally an or Cascade goes forward	6251.48	4.92
they should be able to gain position get	6254.12	4.241
that default plant in and this is going	6256.40	4.44
to be hard to uproot loud with five	6258.36	4.96
alive but here comes thr to try thr and	6260.84	4.68
giving time for T even to rot to across	6263.32	4.919
and still get the pick though onto zelus	6265.52	4.56
as we got one looks like he was detained	6268.24	3.201
towards the back of yellow I think that	6270.08	3.8
was going to be less here but an off	6271.44	4.88
shot missed here by z q answering back	6273.88	4.64
on the 10 looking good for loud on the	6276.32	3.279
post	6278.52	4.28
plant you needed T to come across with	6279.60	5.0
these flashes to help but instead it's	6282.80	3.839
loud winning this pul plan pushing	6284.60	5.441
forward and dropping the igl again we	6286.64	5.321
talked about it took a while for loud	6290.04	5.04
and talking about loud with a definite	6291.96	5.12
strong lead in a map and they're	6295.08	3.76
definitely showing it here on ice box in	6297.08	4.48
a perfect correction to the way the wall	6298.84	6.52
was being used against them at B they	6301.56	5.96
throw that this wall from before the at	6305.36	3.839
the end of the round they do still throw	6307.52	3.199
the wall that covers snowman but look	6309.20	3.48
how far up they are now they're not at	6310.72	3.92
yellow trying to take the long distant	6312.68	5.601
fight well corrected by loud for the	6314.64	6.48
84 at least he's making me smile and	6318.28	4.319
Mimi indeed we can never count out the	6321.12	3.361
Brazilians now as they take the lead	6322.60	3.921
mentioned before a very strong first	6324.48	3.28
half that they shown on their attack	6326.52	2.88
this time Sentinels trying to see what	6327.76	4.2
they're going to look like on their own	6329.40	4.239
attack side we know that loud has been	6331.96	2.759
very annoying with this double	6333.64	2.881
controller against EG how they're able	6334.72	3.761
to lock down this bside and that's why	6336.52	4.0
SEL for the beginning of this pistol are	6338.48	4.4
looking to move five players with by the	6340.52	4.599
potential pul plant situation yeah it	6342.88	4.319
does you see the armor and the two	6345.12	4.08
mollies on zelis that makes me think	6347.20	3.841
zelis wants to be the last alive with a	6349.20	3.96
bit of protection and that Molly post	6351.04	3.679
plant let's see what Sentinels tries to	6353.16	4.121
do loud with great util dump into the	6354.72	6.44
side just got it and deny Sentinels and	6357.28	6.12
also Deni the two Nanos swarms that was	6361.16	3.721
going for that plant so that's going to	6363.40	3.44
be even more difficult for Sentinels to	6364.88	4.279
play that P plan staying anchored up	6366.84	3.52
that's the name of the game that's what	6369.16	3.281
they have to do when they can't until Z	6370.36	4.319
finally pops the first one against loud	6372.44	4.799
cow gets the flank onto 10 second is now	6374.68	4.96
alone the double swing high low and that	6377.24	5.321
looks really good a slight mistake on	6379.64	5.52
just waiting the timing of that plant	6382.56	5.88
denied by the shock darts of cine allows	6385.16	5.08
for them to score nine right and the	6388.44	3.48
focus that Zeal is with like you said	6390.24	4.041
was to have two Molly's post PL	6391.92	5.199
everything was instantly snuffed out by	6394.28	6.56
loud that was planned protocol at its	6397.12	5.281
best right there beautifully done you	6400.84	3.56
see it again in the shots just	6402.40	3.92
absolutely	6404.40	5.56
connecting a uh Far Cry indifference	6406.32	5.68
from what we had first round pistol of	6409.96	4.92
tens and zis just cleaning up the right	6412.00	5.76
side of the map loud finally get theirs	6414.88	4.56
they start off here in the second half	6417.76	3.359
exactly how they want but they're going	6419.44	3.719
to match up against Stingers it's not	6421.12	4.761
the classic buy from sen they're going	6423.16	4.52
right into this with	6425.88	4.56
aggression this going to be a reckoning	6427.68	5.841
buildup for tuis that seems to be the	6430.44	5.279
focus looks like SOS couldn't punish it	6433.52	4.0
cuz of the Cascade that came out so they	6435.72	5.4
cut noise in s and looking for the snow	6437.52	7.0
wall after the KO knife gets shot out	6441.12	4.761
double flash clearing out the back of	6444.52	3.599
the site once again just trying to bait	6445.88	4.839
out utility wingman though looking for	6448.12	4.48
the set of to plant for the a tower so	6450.72	4.281
changing things around just parkouring	6452.60	4.841
across the a site plant now comes down	6455.00	5.679
alen joone only spots Z but already loud	6457.44	5.6
has funneled back and pushed towards the	6460.68	4.641
back of the a site Sassi scores first	6463.04	4.559
long range with the stinger and	6465.32	4.0
definitely fighting forward alarm bot to	6467.60	3.241
also ring the bell allowing here	6469.32	2.879
Sentinels to try to fight back on the	6470.84	3.64
left side of 410 but Les is able to even	6472.20	4.081
up the tally the Stinger by from	6474.48	3.92
Sentinels they're trying to keep the	6476.28	4.839
weapons and the engagement Close n no	6478.40	4.92
storm getting a pick on to qck a three	6481.12	4.401
versus three as a time is in favor of	6483.32	4.96
SEL so far the high tide coming up TS	6485.52	4.679
with the longarm range Stinger once	6488.28	6.439
again s are able to score on the FL	6490.20	7.761
spy Sentinels push through on the four	6494.72	6.721
spy and completely take loud off guard	6497.96	5.239
no idea that was going to happen in	6501.44	3.679
sight and it wasn't a flank it's nothing	6503.20	4.361
out Sentinels behind each other pushing	6505.12	5.241
straight through sashy been incredible	6507.56	4.36
with the Stinger T has been incredible	6510.36	2.96
with the	6511.92	4.12
stinger and the positioning that they	6513.32	5.359
had as well on pipes was incredible to	6516.04	4.32
be able to pick up those kills that tens	6518.68	2.881
had there towards the end of the round	6520.36	4.0
and shut down the defuse wow Sal	6521.56	4.119
Sentinels come up huge there what are	6524.36	2.68
loud going to do they go to a Bucky they	6525.68	4.801
go to a low by Sentinels now can start	6527.04	7.119
to push for a possible win on this map	6530.48	6.52
they need to they need to tie it up but	6534.16	4.321
that could easily happen now with the	6537.00	2.8
way this would	6538.48	4.52
swing loud taking every precaution on	6539.80	5.879
the defensive side now sadok knows what	6543.00	4.4
to do in these situations they've been	6545.68	2.48
there	6547.40	2.88
before no different how they want to	6548.16	5.401
play this jigler cross spraying through	6550.28	5.959
the top of the a tower Les made it out	6553.56	4.44
with 22 HP remaining and instantly we're	6556.24	6.521
moving forward for a plant oh oh red	6558.00	7.48
looks like the ears were spotted there	6562.76	5.64
by sedak with the sheriff adsing down	6565.48	5.96
Bing the plant for them to move forward	6568.40	5.56
at least the backstab is there zelus	6571.44	4.719
watching that flame dropping qck flashes	6573.96	4.96
moving forward across the high tide you	6576.16	4.321
hear the repel second is just waiting	6578.92	2.6
behind	6580.48	3.679
it they're okay with it for SS there are	6581.52	5.88
playing against pistols at this	6584.16	3.241
point last guys can't really do too much	6588.80	3.879
you already see him going all the way	6591.32	4.72
back you just looking to run in and die	6592.68	6.081
from the spike	6596.04	2.72
after but SEL are looking pretty good so	6599.04	4.52
far getting that Force SP on that second	6601.44	3.36
round and winning the way that it did	6603.56	2.92
really fo the plans now for allowed to	6604.80	4.12
have a very strong start on the second	6606.48	5.08
half it down I mean I think they they	6608.92	4.96
quickly identified as well with the the	6611.56	5.28
Cascade they're seeing tuis having alts	6613.88	4.48
that they might have been able to to	6616.84	3.399
sting or Rush the second one catching	6618.36	4.239
loud off guard catching them in a in a	6620.24	4.041
position where they feel safe to grab an	6622.60	4.56
orb and then reset Sentinels they want	6624.28	6.2
to attack as fast as possible and just	6627.16	5.761
from screens there they're figuring out	6630.48	3.8
that they can take it down so there	6632.92	2.84
needs to be a little bit more protection	6634.28	3.12
as they head towards that Nest area for	6635.76	4.76
PL on wingman now I still love the uh	6637.40	6.04
the play that you saw there from hiding	6640.52	4.559
all the way back toward spawn get that	6643.44	4.6
pick and Dinos Spike allowing him to be	6645.08	3.961
one	6648.04	3.8
away from the	6649.04	5.24
ult of course it was the kill that was	6651.84	5.04
more important to get that ult point	6654.28	5.439
than his death from the spike in s and	6656.88	4.839
and allows for them to maybe try to look	6659.72	3.241
for that pressure to pick up that or	6661.72	3.081
towards bide cuz SEL never really took	6662.96	4.279
control of that bide but SEL in round	6664.80	5.68
number 16 decided to do it and they deny	6667.24	4.88
the opportunity of loud of building up	6670.48	3.84
ultimates here it's been a while since	6672.12	4.6
we've seen this little box shot the back	6674.32	5.44
of snowman you can hit on top of green	6676.72	4.281
and now they're	6679.76	4.359
waiting for qck it did look like that	6681.00	4.639
Dash went across I think he's got the	6684.12	3.56
call second can saw that little hair bun	6685.64	3.281
fly	6687.68	5.121
through and now they wait and they call	6688.92	6.0
such a good wait the patience of	6692.80	4.64
Sentinels causes loud to go for the full	6694.92	5.279
rotation expecting an a hit a free sight	6697.44	4.239
here and it's going to be the call from	6700.20	3.641
sedak that they need to come back what a	6701.68	3.92
deep	6703.84	4.279
plan oh they're still going they want to	6705.60	3.841
definitely try to start working and	6708.12	3.321
fighting towards the spawn you see a set	6709.44	3.759
up from T but this time he actually he	6711.44	3.719
doesn't have a flash to work with so	6713.20	3.4
it's really going to be Zin trying to	6715.16	2.96
catch one early sees that there's no	6716.60	2.841
early pressure coming out here's the	6718.12	4.241
alone falls back into sight instead so	6719.44	4.96
an opportunity now for allow to rescale	6722.36	4.279
for the retake in the B site Z behind	6724.40	4.799
the Cascade a one for one though one	6726.64	4.161
coming through blocking Vision on the	6729.20	3.44
left side of yellow three players posted	6730.80	3.439
up there for Sentinels on that post plan	6732.64	3.361
as well so you hear the utility coming	6734.24	4.44
out for the retemper take zelis on the	6736.00	4.599
top of green look at all that delay for	6738.68	3.881
that utility for sels on that pulse but	6740.60	4.0
as well and looks like we want to try to	6742.56	4.24
save to fight for another day to try to	6744.60	4.961
keep the op for qk oh my gosh but	6746.80	5.399
Sentinels will get	6749.56	2.639
seven six rounds for Sentinels to	6752.96	7.119
solidify themselves as the kings of	6756.32	6.6
Na it's crazy to think it's that close	6760.08	4.6
loud's still on the lead though this's	6762.92	3.08
work to be	6764.68	4.121
done see here this push through from	6766.00	5.88
Sentinels taking loud off guard and the	6768.80	6.2
play the macro on that round absolutely	6771.88	4.96
throwing loud and Sak for a loop you're	6775.00	2.92
definitely seeing the hope there from	6776.84	3.56
SEL for sure coming back in the second	6777.92	4.08
half when they were so strong on the	6780.40	3.52
defensive side for the beginning of the	6782.00	4.679
series or even for kickoff so far	6783.92	5.56
showing that they can have the momentum	6786.68	4.321
and the potential to really close out a	6789.48	3.759
very strong attack side on ice box as	6791.00	3.92
well as a change of pace change of	6793.24	4.041
position from loud same wall but from a	6794.92	4.4
different position to block out Vision	6797.28	5.48
on M and green zelus decides to walk up	6799.32	5.08
on this and the rest of SEL is holding	6802.76	3.839
behind it there's nobody really watching	6804.40	4.92
an asight push except for an alarm bot	6806.60	4.56
yeah and I I I find that interesting too	6809.32	2.879
that it's an alarm bot instead of a	6811.16	2.52
turret cuz somebody could now move up on	6812.20	4.561
the top of L so for me maybe SEL are	6813.68	4.641
really looking to commit towards this B	6816.76	3.399
sign exactly maybe the pace they move	6818.32	3.52
they feel comfortable just going forward	6820.16	4.361
knowing the back won't be timed and yeah	6821.84	3.92
they're going to get into position	6824.52	3.44
really fast here a stinger a guardian	6825.76	4.76
but the operator's there for QC did not	6827.96	4.759
expect Zin to be on top of yellow tuis	6830.52	5.159
with the wide swing and gets picked off	6832.72	5.041
qk is too far behind he's still	6835.68	4.0
anchoring towards the aite with that	6837.76	3.8
operator here's a chance here for	6839.68	4.361
Sentinels to move up Recon Dart prepped	6841.56	4.48
up ready but it shock darts instead same	6844.04	3.52
plant position behind the wall and	6846.04	3.36
there's no utility there to deny him and	6847.56	3.32
as I say that the shot guards came	6849.40	4.08
through a good way to recognize from	6850.88	4.4
last round to this round that loud can	6853.48	3.759
stop that plant that's the call from	6855.28	4.08
sadak saying they planted deep the team	6857.24	4.96
saw to we can deny that the next time	6859.36	4.839
they do it they have to have an	6862.20	3.52
important timing here as that's a nice	6864.20	4.201
shot from qck talk about s the Wall came	6865.72	3.88
up they can pick it up and try to go for	6868.40	3.839
a pla meanwhile coming out from celus	6869.60	5.161
who gets a pick onto sadak on middle ju	6872.24	5.081
K now no targets available for a pick	6874.76	3.919
with the operator especially when the	6877.32	3.399
Wall comes up zel is also lurking	6878.68	3.92
through towards that kitchen here's the	6880.72	3.761
shot from the operator here's the	6882.60	4.161
footsteps of cine falling back towards	6884.48	4.28
orange so the rest of L pressing forward	6886.76	3.76
towards yellow and a nice spam through	6888.76	4.8
the poison orb Q Falls now a tap on that	6890.52	4.76
Spike baiting out the swings from the	6893.56	3.84
Sentinels but no picks until celus gets	6895.28	4.64
the lurk kill one more to go celsus	6897.40	5.44
again with the lurk to put three in	6899.92	5.92
round and putting sels one run away up	6902.84	5.48
tying the game we heard Kaplan talking	6905.84	5.44
to smicks at halim about how it's John	6908.32	5.44
cue and zelis and you have to think that	6911.28	5.08
there was a lot of zalis going in to	6913.76	5.359
that round the timing the calls how much	6916.36	4.879
time they needed to defend in sight or	6919.12	4.641
play back in sight for him to get there	6921.24	5.521
in the flank controls the map we see	6923.76	4.52
zelus come up with two big ones there	6926.76	4.839
towards the end 9 to8 now Sentinels only	6928.28	5.76
trailing by one with the last four	6931.60	4.881
rounds in their favor get out of my way	6934.04	3.92
it's going to be a push down here loud	6936.48	3.56
wants to start to get aggressive even on	6937.96	4.32
their Low by they have to get under the	6940.04	3.84
skin of Sentinels here they can't keep	6942.28	4.52
playing default it seems qk just Hur the	6943.88	4.719
turret actually he's still in range	6946.80	4.799
where by somebody but instead just wants	6948.60	5.921
to deny visibility for Sentinels by	6951.60	5.04
breaking a turret early so Sentinels	6954.52	4.52
pushing towards the a side instead	6956.64	4.241
should be a wingman plan here trade back	6959.04	4.199
and forth nice shot by qck Dash	6960.88	4.759
activated as well Stinger upgrade back	6963.24	4.84
into the sheriff sank bite pushing away	6965.64	5.361
Reckoning instantly getting popped as	6968.08	5.6
Sassi gets the plant from the wing	6971.00	5.239
manist now there's that jump up sashy	6973.68	5.201
almost got that pick onto Les jumping up	6976.24	4.36
towards the a who does get a pick of his	6978.88	3.239
own with the sheriff we talk about the	6980.60	3.52
LLY here loud has to make plays and it's	6982.12	5.401
working out Aline no contact L with the	6984.12	7.201
wall bang onto S as well up to the igl	6987.52	5.92
John cue springing across left and right	6991.32	4.44
now let is sticking on that plant it's	6993.44	3.679
looking pretty good here to hold it in	6995.76	5.28
the end the lower by four L the Thrifty	6997.12	5.761
as the answer right back and that hope	7001.04	3.88
is slowly dwindling away here since	7002.88	4.48
Sentinels forced by in the second round	7004.92	4.6
of the half the Cove really putting it	7007.36	4.279
damper there on Sentinels trying to get	7009.52	4.599
to the spike Sai throws out a m just	7011.64	4.6
boink right	7014.12	4.761
off and that's crazy that he's able to	7016.24	4.561
get and break the turret down towards	7018.88	3.6
bottom M and still come back to get an	7020.80	5.04
opener on holding the a	7022.48	6.96
site loud making the perfect little	7025.84	5.759
Corrections here crash in this coming	7029.44	3.36
round and then they're going to have the	7031.60	3.04
sight with a lock down if they don't	7032.80	4.08
have that to hold for or if they if um	7034.64	3.921
they don't use it they can have it for	7036.88	3.44
the next round so a lot of things loud	7038.56	6.2
has to deal with right now sheriff for	7040.32	4.44
Less he's got money there wait a minute	7044.96	4.8
like no way you just have a sheriff	7048.36	3.879
right now we just talked about this	7049.76	4.24
there yeah you'd mentioned clearing out	7052.24	3.201
I mean that's the path that they usually	7054.00	3.239
do here with the smash they could around	7055.44	4.56
the 410 yeah pick it back up and Al just	7057.24	4.681
behind 410 to really gain even more	7060.00	3.8
space allowing time for them to set up	7061.92	5.199
for a full PL out that's why you see	7063.80	6.0
zela moving up with the team John C one	7067.12	5.12
watching the flank to start the knife to	7069.80	3.72
see if loud's going to try to push	7072.24	3.081
forward with qck on the Y but he's	7073.52	3.719
posted up towards b	7075.32	3.919
instead	7077.24	5.281
initi so cycling the lock down before	7079.24	5.561
the thrash to start things	7082.52	5.44
off don't get in my way Les is just	7084.80	6.24
trying to get that timing why not yeah	7087.96	6.92
he'll be fine back there to run back	7091.04	3.84
in PL on the left side though ooh they	7095.20	5.44
do get the spray on behind the Cascade	7098.56	4.599
so that Spike down remember the thrash	7100.64	4.96
is still available for Sashi zela	7103.16	4.48
getting some sprays it's the battle	7105.60	4.12
inside that pit playing on the	7107.64	3.56
extremities of it but with that Spike	7109.72	3.081
being down out in the open looks like we	7111.20	3.241
have to try to reset for Sentinels it's	7112.80	3.72
a thrash to Make Some Noise allowing zel	7114.44	4.04
once again to look for a timing on that	7116.52	4.28
flank underhand flash being thrown Spike	7118.48	4.96
now being picked up as they pull back	7120.80	4.6
away from this leaving Z on the top but	7123.44	3.799
this whole time as zelus is lurking	7125.40	4.0
towards middle that op was always	7127.24	4.521
towards that b side and if they don't	7129.40	3.799
use the right utility to try to clear it	7131.76	3.6
here 30 seconds	7133.20	5.44
qck can have some easy picks the lurks	7135.36	5.2
or the the rotations have been so late	7138.64	4.321
for the last member of loud this time	7140.56	4.48
it's going to pay off that's well done	7142.96	4.199
here on a positioning from loud because	7145.04	3.88
of that op being posted up on the B side	7147.16	3.201
they could focus on the kitchen on the	7148.92	3.52
rotate down at the under pass even the	7150.36	4.839
op gets the pick	7152.44	5.679
time all them falling down 5 seconds	7155.20	4.721
left actually there is time at this	7158.12	3.761
point when T picks it	7159.92	5.44
up so two versus two the shorty T still	7161.88	4.68
gets the	7165.36	4.16
kill but Les now in a clerk situation	7166.56	5.4
information where T is at the high low T	7169.52	5.84
doesn't even need it oh my gosh how did	7171.96	5.32
that happened for senal to be able to	7175.36	3.96
convert that round when they dropped	7177.28	4.28
that spike in that	7179.32	5.64
kitchen it looks	7181.56	3.4
impossible qck with the shot it gets to	7186.12	4.04
n	7189.00	4.679
the just out of range with the shorty as	7190.16	6.761
well Sentinels they're kind of just	7193.68	4.761
going for it in these moments you know	7196.92	3.44
you have no other choice there to plant	7198.44	3.56
but to make it happen the positioning	7200.36	4.839
counted and loud did not that shorty	7202.00	5.079
kill was it right that that pretty much	7205.20	3.52
solidifies for the rest to come around	7207.08	4.321
and figure out what they need to do want	7208.72	5.36
to go quick a flash over the high tide	7211.40	4.16
and then a disy towards the front an	7214.08	3.321
aggressive push for a Zin almost got	7215.56	3.36
that punish onto two East but there's	7217.40	3.56
the from out the head on up the sa the	7218.92	4.12
spike is down L commen denies also his	7220.96	4.04
KN trying to run away towards yellow	7223.04	3.599
second pushes forward for the two kills	7225.00	3.52
open it up the bide for a bit there's	7226.64	4.121
still one player left it's sedak with	7228.52	4.559
the B pushing for it gets the kill up to	7230.76	5.72
Z who was protecting the spike PL as L	7233.08	6.56
gets a nice shot the rotate from behind	7236.48	5.4
unfortunately there for cine almost had	7239.64	4.08
the opportunity to get the pick it's off	7241.88	4.64
to the sheriff alone upgrading now to	7243.72	6.121
the Phantom Nur now being used	7246.52	5.48
even the turret on the back the orb	7249.84	4.359
comes down John cuti swings on the other	7252.00	5.719
side and sels have tied up the game just	7254.20	6.601
like that three rounds away from being	7257.72	7.561
the kings of Na Kings of Americas will	7260.80	7.919
they be able to make it happen qck on	7265.28	6.72
this yellow has been doing so much work	7268.72	5.241
and then Sentinels are snapping back	7272.00	3.639
quick they're figuring out what the	7273.96	4.159
dangers are in these situations and	7275.64	4.04
acting according	7278.12	5.0
Z Jersey Finest coming up again laying	7279.68	6.721
people down and yeah we are at	7283.12	6.161
101 the big difference is Sentinels have	7286.40	5.759
two maps under their belt here looking	7289.28	3.919
to	7292.16	3.721
finalize this Harbor wall again	7293.20	4.761
connecting just down long B and then	7295.88	5.0
towards viid to slow and delay but	7297.96	5.159
Sentinels is happy to do this rounds	7300.88	4.279
they move fast they are just going fast	7303.12	4.321
off the rip rounds they move slow they	7305.16	4.401
get the read they want	7307.44	3.52
that's right the job's not done here for	7309.56	3.28
Sentinels for loud they're still looking	7310.96	4.04
pretty good lots of money an operator	7312.84	4.279
out once again for qck towards be made a	7315.00	4.119
jump spot from Z but they also have ult	7317.12	4.721
to work with for the retake so senel has	7319.12	4.52
to continue their due diligence here if	7321.84	3.239
they want to try to win this map but	7323.64	4.801
loud has been looking for answers so far	7325.08	5.881
just to try to close out this map I	7328.44	5.56
think that was a Miss zus walks up like	7330.96	7.279
that the swing for Miss does get the	7334.00	7.4
surprise kill on cine with the contact	7338.24	5.721
DIY now being thrown towards the air	7341.40	5.6
flash moving forward second dashing	7343.96	5.639
up and that lock down comes out	7347.00	4.48
prematurely the spray through the	7349.60	4.401
Cascade second Falls Theo though is a	7351.48	3.84
little bit too far behind I don't think	7354.00	2.96
it's going to break it so that rotates	7355.32	3.799
the players back zel is again trying to	7356.96	4.84
go for that lurk but it gets stopped by	7359.12	4.96
qck with the operator it's a reset with	7361.80	4.76
only 24 seconds left SEL have no choice	7364.08	4.241
but to commit towards the a site but	7366.56	3.039
they still have a p to to work with they	7368.32	2.399
have to get in they don't have wingman	7369.60	2.681
to plant here it's going to take	7370.72	3.681
everybody being in sight to cover this	7372.28	4.68
10's again taking that Nest	7374.40	4.799
position John cuti though not looky to	7376.96	3.759
use his pit there you go brings it out	7379.20	3.241
towards the screen breaking line of	7380.72	3.561
sight for the operator knife even thrown	7382.44	4.48
towards the screen spotting three High	7384.28	5.839
tight separating the a site allowing L	7386.92	4.679
to try to swarm out with the four	7390.12	2.881
players they have remaining they have a	7391.60	3.761
Cove to work with for the diffuse as	7393.00	4.719
well tuis is the one that's going to	7395.36	4.04
have to stay alive here to give chances	7397.72	4.88
for loud to fight back this round 21 10	7399.40	5.48
pushing forward within that pit still	7402.60	4.321
working on the other side or loud	7404.88	5.04
outside the DI sassy gets to spray T	7406.92	6.96
inside the TR come out T gets the third	7409.92	7.52
SEL Take the Lead they only need two now	7413.88	6.6
what a wall coming out from John cue	7417.44	5.799
placed perfectly on the left side of a	7420.48	5.4
sight like you said making loud come	7423.24	4.92
through they have to take damage they	7425.88	4.44
have to worry about he goes back to loud	7428.16	4.121
for one Sentinels correct whatever	7430.32	3.799
happens and they hit even harder the	7432.28	4.56
next time it's it just seems Unstoppable	7434.12	4.56
from them right now two rounds away from	7436.84	3.68
solidifying	7438.68	5.761
this and the walls about to	7440.52	6.679
drop back a for loud they're not going	7444.44	4.4
to play too much they'll put Less on	7447.20	4.0
pipes we know that sheriff is always	7448.84	5.16
always good for one but Sentinels	7451.20	4.96
they're all voting down this be long and	7454.00	3.52
they're making their way towards that	7456.16	3.92
yellow again cuz the high tide didn't	7457.52	4.599
come early anymore they just tried to	7460.08	4.08
really push forward for Sentinels	7462.12	3.681
knowing that the harbor is so far away	7464.16	3.761
they try to assist in theay even more	7465.80	3.799
now it's time for sels to activate their	7467.92	4.319
lock down on this attack side to try to	7469.60	6.56
get the plant in pushing away loud back	7472.24	5.561
towards the window the timing out the	7476.16	3.121
flash misses but it still allows for him	7477.80	3.52
to push forward a wall comes up from two	7479.28	3.839
spring through with the help of sedak	7481.32	4.16
dropping t p plant now still activated	7483.12	5.12
though as the plant comes down for senos	7485.48	5.159
and a diff use attempt for loud a tap on	7488.24	3.88
the spike first a swing out towards the	7490.64	3.161
yellow it's a one for one J with the	7492.12	3.641
head shot of the SAU sake bite on the	7493.80	3.64
ground John trying to stay alive pushed	7495.76	4.24
away as well by the enemy snake bite	7497.44	4.88
Cloud burst up jump towards the air	7500.00	4.719
beautifully done here living J with two	7502.32	5.72
kills with twoes is still there for the	7504.72	7.321
trade loud a bright light there with the	7508.04	5.96
individual skill I think something we've	7512.04	3.599
been missing with the individuals being	7514.00	4.0
able to pop off on their own what a	7515.64	5.52
Cascade from twoes to save himself that	7518.00	4.159
was	7521.16	4.721
insane last second thinking to turn the	7522.16	7.321
round right around get sodock the kill	7525.88	5.6
that would save him and you can see what	7529.48	5.0
it means to loud that was a big one	7531.48	4.84
almost being suffocated out of the game	7534.48	3.159
if they weren't able to take that round	7536.32	3.359
on the Low by so yeah the Low by comes	7537.64	3.761
up with a win for loud they get a little	7539.68	4.0
more momentum Reckoning is here to deny	7541.40	5.56
a take and operator in the hands of qck	7543.68	5.4
again they have a bit of extremity	7546.96	3.52
control here this is the first time we	7549.08	3.12
see two no okay he just goes up for the	7550.48	4.119
wall thought he was moving forward loud	7552.20	4.44
and alloud fans continue to show that	7554.60	4.761
they're still here to	7556.64	6.0
fight zelis using a different path and	7559.36	4.92
going through the high tide using his	7562.64	4.401
orb to try to lurk inside the kitchen	7564.28	4.839
Sentinels four players set	7567.04	5.079
up slowly moving up	7569.12	5.761
here towards the a site I mean they did	7572.12	4.44
give their information away the first	7574.88	4.16
dizzy that came out so maybe or control	7576.56	3.921
could be the play we're one away from	7579.04	4.119
getting a thrash out for zasi and	7580.48	5.28
Bladestorm and zelis trying to count on	7583.16	4.44
that one couldn't capitalize on that	7585.76	4.16
pick it's the first time zelus has been	7587.60	3.841
kind of the the spearhead of the	7589.92	3.44
strategy he's always the last to move	7591.44	4.84
giving info a was waiting for zelus to	7593.36	4.759
cause the disruption here loud doing a	7596.28	3.68
great job at holding their positions and	7598.12	4.361
not moving on this one Sentinels cannot	7599.96	4.199
find an opening just yet waiting for	7602.48	3.639
util to make that a possibility so you	7604.16	3.48
see the high tide now being thrown from	7606.12	4.04
the generator already crosshairs are set	7607.64	4.241
towards that right side now or finally	7610.16	3.56
picked up trying to use that thash to	7611.88	3.92
create that space But A rightly comes	7613.72	5.081
out the AIO cues allows to spam through	7615.80	5.2
that wall and get two and it's the same	7618.80	4.08
story once again trying to rotate out	7621.00	3.4
and where they're rotating to and up on	7622.88	4.08
the B side beautiful hold is starting	7624.40	4.4
off for loud he's got cement boots over	7626.96	4.48
here he just does not leave the	7628.80	6.04
sight finds him on the rotation but	7631.44	6.719
Spike down 14 seconds left loud gets the	7634.84	5.96
laps last pick and the last last so far	7638.16	5.681
12 to 11 as they're looking to move this	7640.80	5.16
over to B match	7643.84	4.68
point oh my gosh you know what I want to	7645.96	5.08
see bind I want to see our last map	7648.52	5.84
let's go to Five Sentinels calling the	7651.04	5.199
time out here so Kaplan can get in the	7654.36	2.839
ear of the	7656.24	3.88
players chat with zelus and John cue	7657.20	4.681
figure out what's	7660.12	3.841
happening and	7661.88	4.92
Loud really accepting that round well	7663.96	5.279
the Cascade	7666.80	5.24
and just denying Sentinels hey I think	7669.24	5.641
Sentinels understands now that qck is a	7672.04	4.84
staple at whatever sight he's at	7674.88	3.759
depending on the stret or depending on	7676.88	4.16
what they do he'll be at the other sight	7678.64	4.161
if they don't hear the op at the current	7681.04	3.84
attack so they have to worry they have	7682.80	4.439
to figure out a way to push qck	7684.88	4.839
off keep up that's a big question for	7687.24	4.32
them they have the set up though we seen	7689.72	4.4
the dizzy in The Flash before zel up to	7691.56	4.321
get the flash towards	7694.12	5.201
green but has the angle	7695.88	6.04
Flash not does not affect him just	7699.32	3.879
waiting the thrash I don't think he even	7701.92	4.4
got the information oh what almost felt	7703.20	5.561
like that was on him yeah just pulled	7706.32	5.16
away from the flick but T picks up the	7708.76	6.839
alt orb and also has n Comm in in the	7711.48	6.48
ready trying to delay even more a high	7715.60	3.6
TI comes out all the way back from	7717.96	3.92
Kitchen that's tuis slowing down any	7719.20	4.561
type of push that Seno's trying to take	7721.88	4.199
towards green after getting that Al	7723.76	6.0
anticipating a n Comm in Hit	7726.08	5.08
zelis going to start doing a little	7729.76	3.76
roaming towards belt as they keep an eye	7731.16	4.92
on Mid great choice by loud and how	7733.52	4.52
they've rotated this coverage to lean	7736.08	4.881
over towards the B site and yeah seeing	7738.04	4.4
Saucy you're probably like okay wingman	7740.96	3.84
Spike we got it per perfect lot of	7742.44	4.4
information there for	7744.80	4.2
loud but it's Mind Games look at him	7746.84	3.759
rotating back towards the a side they're	7749.00	3.52
thinking hey SEL might pull back towards	7750.60	4.401
the abling for it the gamble doesn't	7752.52	4.599
turn out this time around it worked for	7755.00	4.639
at least two Allin	7757.12	4.401
but this time sels are pushing forward	7759.64	3.881
in the a site this is a very sketchy	7761.52	4.84
plan wingman comes out for a plant sedak	7763.52	4.599
gets the pick and a second one off to	7766.36	5.12
zelus qck with the off kill on to Z not	7768.12	5.721
even needed the assist the p on the last	7771.48	5.32
one the fall is trouble out us are able	7773.84	5.879
to push this into a fourth M They're all	7776.80	4.68
playing back to where tens can be tens	7779.72	2.801
again it's not a Chet but it's going to	7781.48	3.239
be a yoru and you'll see gate crashes	7782.52	4.4
that go all the way into attacker spawn	7784.72	3.761
possibly with what they're trying trying	7786.92	3.799
to cook up and I'm sure loud has seen	7788.48	4.199
that I'm sure sedak knows T is going to	7790.72	4.041
be trying to Route them at all times	7792.68	4.04
they go for a bit of a default here with	7794.76	5.04
focus on hookah so far making sure those	7796.72	5.321
extremities are not owned by Sentinels	7799.80	5.52
right now seems like T is set up to do a	7802.04	5.88
flashbang dance yeah exactly while the	7805.32	4.44
contact was there from zel's towards of	7807.92	3.679
U-Haul but as there's no contact there	7809.76	3.24
there is that solo play from the	7811.60	3.241
initiator once again but second went	7813.00	4.679
through the TP loud still answers back	7814.84	4.12
as they have the player advantage in	7817.68	2.92
this pistol round 10's trying to gain	7818.96	5.759
some more map control up towards short	7820.60	6.841
no what it's not supposed to work like	7824.72	4.721
that it's almost like bread crumbs on a	7827.44	4.639
trail it's like piece of candy oh piece	7829.44	5.119
of candy oh my	7832.08	5.401
gosh three on three zelus now finally	7834.56	6.12
spots the contact in towards this a	7837.48	6.04
sight decoy thrown out by tens not being	7840.68	5.44
shot out the bait doesn't work here for	7843.52	5.32
Lou first one tap on the SP Spike trying	7846.12	4.721
to see what the hot hands are going here	7848.84	4.2
for the attack trying to delay and deny	7850.84	5.04
the flank to happen trying to get a TP	7853.04	4.76
but thankfully it's only C that fell the	7855.88	4.44
[ __ ] still up they spot SAS on the back	7857.80	5.439
stab there's another TP Les re swings	7860.32	6.319
picks the pick onto Sashi Z then comes	7863.24	6.201
back out and somehow it has become	7866.64	5.44
individual Peaks one by one by Sentinels	7869.44	5.159
putting T in a clutch situation nice	7872.08	4.841
long range there by Les and this is not	7874.60	5.08
a good time if you're a Sentinels fan to	7876.92	6.92
see less Stern activate loud very happy	7879.68	6.721
though Vans you have to know it they	7883.84	6.16
have started down on every map last I	7886.40	5.6
mean last map we went back and forth and	7890.00	4.76
Loud found their ground but this is	7892.00	4.8
going to be a nice start for them here	7894.76	3.72
as long as sen don't get that second	7896.80	3.399
round again as as long as they don't	7898.48	3.4
looks like the classic by looks like	7900.20	3.841
Sentinels will not be able to formulate	7901.88	4.44
that purchase on this one course	7904.04	3.679
defensive sign here that you see from	7906.32	3.799
Sentinels but no gamble stack it's	7907.72	4.041
actually a heavy pressure towards the a	7910.12	3.921
side of flash to try to pinch for	7911.76	4.879
information coming out from long B just	7914.04	5.079
simple orb control putting in the hands	7916.64	4.121
of	7919.12	4.52
tens looking for this timing already one	7920.76	4.959
one flash thrown by sashy so getting a	7923.64	3.761
quick peek to see if that was true and	7925.72	3.561
they are still pushing	7927.40	4.719
up and now just a pressure game but	7929.28	4.68
three in	7932.12	4.0
showers they're going to leave 10 here	7933.96	3.84
for sure and then back up towards the	7936.12	3.161
rest of the site now they'll play the	7937.80	3.12
site kind of vertically instead of	7939.28	3.839
horizontally if U-Haul control is gained	7940.92	4.12
they'll just fight loud out of U-Haul as	7943.12	3.48
much as they	7945.04	4.639
can oh my what a read just holding the	7946.60	5.56
whole time and they can hear it too for	7949.68	4.52
now right now it's just meeting up here	7952.16	4.48
from the spawn a walk contact Z is going	7954.20	5.281
to be the first one sees it on the first	7956.64	4.681
what a smart Peak T now switching back	7959.48	3.48
to right click instead the hot hands	7961.32	4.239
being thrown it's	7962.96	6.0
clear it's allows L to split the a site	7965.56	6.64
smokes all abundance inside a within the	7968.96	7.32
smokes qck gets the execution onto zelus	7972.20	5.44
there's still players there though all	7976.28	3.959
of Cals have rotated towards the a side	7977.64	4.241
trying to do at least some sort of	7980.24	4.761
damage that's John cue with two but with	7981.88	5.359
that round here you'll have the run it	7985.00	4.8
back activated for QC in their bonus	7987.24	5.801
round and Loud even with these two	7989.80	6.359
rounds look like they're in so much more	7993.04	5.28
of a Groove they have the read on	7996.16	4.4
Sentinels they know ten is going to be	7998.32	5.399
somewhere ratty trying to be funky on	8000.56	6.881
the yoru instant Peak Z did not pull	8003.72	6.161
their attention away they are ready for	8007.44	3.96
the tricks that Sentinels will bring to	8009.88	4.319
the table here all right onto the next	8011.40	5.239
one loud look pick up this bonus would	8014.20	5.121
be gigantic especially on the Low by	8016.64	4.801
they're forced into here due to some	8019.32	4.96
deaths n wanted some showers control out	8021.44	5.08
for loud Camp they did	8024.28	5.04
it convert in that second round from the	8026.52	5.32
pistol now the bonus pressure came	8029.32	4.48
towards this bside knife was being	8031.84	3.52
thrown to get some information towards	8033.80	4.48
the garden SEL still able to play a four	8035.36	5.04
position inside hooka though a TP across	8038.28	3.2
once	8040.40	3.719
again s by being thrown a one for one	8041.48	5.52
Surprise Play actually it's a win here	8044.12	4.681
for loud cuz they could upgrade a weapon	8047.00	3.96
left behind by	8048.80	5.279
zeen underhead flash John K's fully	8050.96	5.36
blinded but stays in the	8054.08	4.441
Smoke easy out	8056.32	5.399
there loud continues to pressure at	8058.52	4.36
hookah	8061.72	3.48
area T now if you look at the mini map	8062.88	4.48
throws this Gate Crash again goes all	8065.20	4.04
the way to spawn and'll have a rotation	8067.36	4.64
around the side of loud if it comes to	8069.24	5.761
it weak great shot by cenen still a	8072.00	5.639
great opener then the Wall comes up on	8075.00	4.76
defense keeping J CD alive was important	8077.64	3.321
here so they could spray across for	8079.76	3.52
these two kills now it doesn't really	8080.96	5.599
matter on this TP a flash moving forward	8083.28	5.359
allowing sels to push up get the wall	8086.56	5.56
bang onto seds Che all alone Vandal in	8088.64	5.721
hand 26 seconds left so he's got time to	8092.12	6.04
work with the first shot now shows that	8094.36	5.64
he did try to look for some cover	8098.16	4.161
Through The Brimstone smoke yeah John	8100.00	4.92
CYT just winning on the other side	8102.32	5.759
letting Sashi be the first Contact oh	8104.92	5.96
there's the back stab oh with the third	8108.08	5.201
almost saw that coming my	8110.88	5.0
gosh somehow the positioning of tens	8113.28	5.24
could have been costly there	8115.88	4.6
as it seems as though sashy thought that	8118.52	4.92
he had his back but thankfully John cue	8120.48	5.159
was there for the save tu's putting a	8123.44	5.52
scare Factor on that round for Sentinels	8125.64	5.92
a 3v one and we almost saw him go down	8128.96	5.08
one by one one enemy remaining and look	8131.56	4.52
at that replay you just saw the last two	8134.04	5.0
times that second went for pain shells	8136.08	5.201
to open the door sneak by towards that	8139.04	5.92
front so they do have a a heavy pressure	8141.28	5.72
set up to try to really get some players	8144.96	4.04
vulnerable and line up some kills they	8147.00	4.04
love teleporters too oh it starts off	8149.00	4.119
right away it was just saying both zelus	8151.04	4.44
and Z have used the teleporter now even	8153.12	3.96
with that util as we have a first shower	8155.48	3.52
hit and it's not going to stop TR Blazer	8157.08	4.52
trying to bait out the player is	8159.00	5.199
focusing on that dog so that Zin could	8161.60	4.921
try to swing out again for the pick but	8164.20	4.4
everything calms down now	8166.52	5.92
yeah man that was quick both players	8168.60	6.0
realizing it was uh both teams it was	8172.44	4.56
just attempt at showers to see how how	8174.60	4.361
deep they would go	8177.00	4.92
now back towards mid switched up a few	8178.96	5.44
times Ela up top good timing on that one	8181.92	6.159
from coward Zen saw the shoulder as Elsa	8184.40	6.08
gets the pick Leo walks through his own	8188.08	5.001
orb to answer right back with the second	8190.48	5.839
one to avenge his teammate on top of	8193.08	5.359
that giving it Advantage for loud on the	8196.32	5.441
pulse PL snake bite even misses	8198.44	5.0
y	8201.76	4.28
holding and they knowing Viper there	8203.44	4.08
only have to look for the flank now cuz	8206.04	4.359
they going to have shower control loud	8207.52	4.92
really cleanly Gathering these rounds	8210.40	3.92
especially after that shower we see	8212.44	4.641
sadak recalling the hit toward short	8214.32	5.36
loud seems on point for these strats now	8217.08	4.08
and they take back a gun round after	8219.68	3.521
that Bonus Goes the way of Sentinels	8221.16	3.8
just the last few shots here and	8223.20	3.72
preventative utility to shut out	8224.96	3.759
Sentinels gambled the sake bites here	8226.92	4.12
just flush out some positions but loud	8228.72	4.92
doubled up and U-Haul one towards	8231.04	4.12
showers and they have their own utility	8233.64	3.641
for the P SP as well not looking good at	8235.16	5.0
all spray comes across stays alive at 6	8237.28	5.72
hp but at the end of the day it still	8240.16	4.72
loud's	8243.00	5.04
round they go 3-1	8244.88	6.96
up the attack from L it's it seems like	8248.04	5.92
they're moving quick enough but also	8251.84	5.36
taking care of the extremities loud is	8253.96	5.96
that t isn't getting to use the yoru	8257.20	4.279
like we saw in the last bind game from	8259.92	4.36
Sentinels it was much more destructive	8261.48	4.601
much more distracting to the opponent	8264.28	4.239
here and you know what I say that and we	8266.08	3.96
might get it out of a dimensional drift	8268.52	3.16
here if he starts getting in the brains	8270.04	4.24
of loud trying to Ping him out for this	8271.68	5.201
strategy running back can happen just as	8274.28	4.6
well with that ultimate from Brimstone	8276.88	3.599
in the orbital strike so they may just	8278.88	3.96
microwave U-Haul here once they get the	8280.48	4.601
chance might be difficult one here as	8282.84	4.12
they have a low by for Sentinels on that	8285.08	4.2
end though doubling up towards the boxes	8286.96	3.639
at the short	8289.28	4.72
a loud already just held back by that	8290.60	5.401
smoke that was dropped on the defensive	8294.00	4.88
side that being here by zelus ready to	8296.00	5.8
gate crash out of a	8298.88	2.92
shot it's being quiet right here they	8302.80	4.28
they tried to play the contact after	8305.08	4.92
that smoke knowing the position lik to	8307.08	5.359
play on they'll use a run it back to	8310.00	4.8
even confirm that the main default	8312.44	5.92
position of the aite is open spotting	8314.80	6.32
zelus at triple utility being used out	8318.36	4.641
here on both ends deniability from snake	8321.12	3.64
bites all the way out from the be site	8323.00	4.679
landing at the default spot preventing a	8324.76	5.36
from coming down also making sure that	8327.68	3.8
the smokes could dissipate but the	8330.12	3.319
second smoke comes down another tap	8331.48	4.321
utility baiting out zel is trying to get	8333.44	4.2
some right clicks everybody's hiding in	8335.80	3.919
the thick of the spark but there's that	8337.64	4.561
first Blood finally inside the a site as	8339.72	4.561
Q moves forward now being pressured by	8342.20	4.04
zel's right click classic coming	8344.28	3.96
through that's really going to SL the	8346.24	3.72
bleeding after this loud is in a	8348.24	3.88
beautiful setup towards the end better	8349.96	4.559
Weaponry last player standing even	8352.12	5.04
better health so much more confidence	8354.52	4.761
coming out of these loud strategies we	8357.16	5.159
just saw loud tempt the plant without	8359.28	5.68
having showers control knowing how much	8362.32	4.841
it would RI up send they only had a	8364.96	3.96
smoke covering shower that doesn't	8367.16	3.199
prevent anything they were accepting	8368.92	2.759
mollies they were getting shot while	8370.36	3.881
planning loud wanted to take that fight	8371.68	5.04
and qck as you said pushing through to	8374.24	5.76
break that defensive smoke absolutely	8376.72	6.441
threw sen off nicely done here by loud	8380.00	5.559
to get another round secured they do it	8383.16	3.8
differently too giving sen a different	8385.56	3.641
look to work work with John C is going	8386.96	4.0
to have Al for next round but loud's	8389.20	3.4
feeling good on the momentum and they'll	8390.96	4.479
have Cowen Zen probably on Al along with	8392.60	5.36
tuis so we'll see this again once once	8395.44	4.841
qck got to that right side it caused a	8397.96	3.2
lot of	8400.28	3.96
trouble and then it was just hunting	8401.16	5.44
after that with blood in the water yeah	8404.24	3.68
thankfully those silver letting for	8406.60	2.879
Sentinels the Phantom that they save in	8407.92	3.24
a previous round became the Phantom they	8409.48	4.161
save into this round and also on top of	8411.16	4.76
that the economy has been built up also	8413.64	4.679
in the ult economy that he could now	8415.92	3.96
finally maybe start using that	8418.32	2.641
dimensional	8419.88	4.559
drift are moving up here for information	8420.96	5.399
and control T positioning all the way	8424.44	4.201
towards the left side as well and could	8426.36	5.12
TP instantly towards the a site should L	8428.64	5.56
try to pressure in the pit the John cuti	8431.48	5.681
just plays down towards	8434.20	2.96
mid Saucy look at me not at T oh the	8437.32	7.481
spam through the bottom left corner and	8442.16	5.239
a punish as T was looking for a Hero	8444.80	3.88
play to trade her right back and maybe	8447.40	4.401
TP away so that's two players falling	8448.68	5.08
down sashy alone on the anchor towards	8451.80	4.48
the back of the	8453.76	2.52
site it's again the 1 V one prowess	8456.68	5.4
right now that loud's able to hit	8459.72	4.48
Sentinels isn't finding these kills from	8462.08	4.2
tens or just the members trying to do	8464.20	3.76
their own little excursions here like	8466.28	3.32
they were on previous maps of this	8467.96	5.359
series loud is tightening everything up	8469.60	5.2
it looks like they could get this entry	8473.32	4.281
into B to count as well s's been good	8474.80	4.559
anchoring the back of the aide of split	8477.60	3.56
can do it this time around on B no looks	8479.36	3.641
like the fall line the side of it just	8481.16	5.199
hit him and Sak's able to punish him for	8483.00	5.72
trying to Anchor solo and do the hero	8486.36	4.761
play last two guys will most likely save	8488.72	4.36
at this	8491.12	5.16
point and they still have Cowen Zen's	8493.08	5.76
alt after the frags on this round	8496.28	4.92
they've been cycling so well here to get	8498.84	4.08
themselves in the sight sodx is going to	8501.20	4.239
be coming up soon I think these next	8502.92	5.12
rounds van silly uh if maybe even a	8505.44	5.201
timeout of for how Sentinels are going	8508.04	4.92
to use this showstopper is it is it to	8510.64	4.799
put pressure on and z and tens are are	8512.96	4.12
activated right are they going to use it	8515.44	3.401
for a retake because right now the	8517.08	5.0
retakes do not seem like their Sentinels	8518.84	5.08
doesn't have enough room to get the	8522.08	4.399
retake they want I should say so that's	8523.92	5.0
going to be a question how is this	8526.48	3.92
showstopper going to turn it around for	8528.92	3.76
sun it's definitely hard to get the room	8530.40	4.641
or to retake when you're losing players	8532.68	4.6
in the process of what loud is currently	8535.04	4.56
doing and really picking players apart	8537.28	4.76
in their positioning Within These sights	8539.60	4.16
so yeah you might come down to those	8542.04	4.04
plays where you have such a low buy	8543.76	3.96
right now for Sentinels it could be a	8546.08	3.96
potential just half buy with rifles and	8547.72	4.56
you have to do that hero play potential	8550.04	4.48
with the hey let's Hail Mary towards	8552.28	4.24
short the amount of times here that	8554.52	3.879
Sentinels or should I say loud try to	8556.52	3.76
contact up towards short and really try	8558.40	3.96
to execute through the brimstone smokes	8560.28	3.36
it could be one of those hey let's try	8562.36	3.481
to flash let's try to showstop her get	8563.64	3.92
one for trouble second hopefully your	8565.84	2.96
Rocket's going to get two or something	8567.56	3.2
like	8568.80	5.679
that or short a I should say let's get	8570.76	5.36
this started the fans are ready time	8574.48	3.681
out's over and we're back on to bind	8576.12	5.12
here 5-1 loud looking to bring us to a	8578.16	4.52
map five with the momentum they	8581.24	5.8
currently have let's do it Vance zela	8582.68	5.799
taking control of shower so there's no	8587.04	3.68
early smoke moving out towards the	8588.48	4.801
extremities of short a looks like we had	8590.72	4.24
a nice flash that came out from sedak	8593.28	2.8
though on the top of the palm tree	8594.96	3.08
blinding two players gets the pick on to	8596.08	4.6
10 not allowing Z to really move forward	8598.04	5.0
with the showstar per Satchel from the	8600.68	5.96
APC beautifully done here by the IGA	8603.04	6.12
sedak off this timeout anticipating some	8606.64	4.2
sort of pressure towards short and that	8609.16	4.279
flash was	8610.84	5.2
everything walk forward the first	8613.44	5.561
Contact in the continuous kills out of	8616.04	5.76
Sentinels Spike down at the same time	8619.00	5.84
Seekers coming out now know that sedak	8621.80	5.639
now pivoted across short toward towards	8624.84	3.479
the	8627.44	3.201
Sands while his teammates beting up with	8628.32	4.641
him here in the back of the	8630.64	4.679
fountain so look at Sentinels how do	8632.96	3.56
they want to Pip this they keep it	8635.32	4.04
towards a 2 two re gaining control	8636.52	4.799
towards hookah so they can spray on one	8639.36	5.641
side they' flow TPS towards the a site	8641.32	5.16
you have two players pushed up in their	8645.00	4.52
area to watch that as well slow movement	8646.48	5.521
through octagon they have to tempt	8649.52	5.08
everything here hoping to find either	8652.00	5.68
util or that	8654.60	4.839
and it's only it's it's Buddy system	8657.68	5.4
right now right movement from John C and	8659.44	5.681
sashy they will not part from each other	8663.08	4.04
just the flank watch on the other side	8665.12	3.159
and then they collapse once they know	8667.12	3.08
the spike is down here but right now zel	8668.28	5.2
is in range here if it did come a moment	8670.20	4.96
where these players fell down towards	8673.48	5.321
long B they had the oral strike so time	8675.16	6.0
was pressur for allow and it did not	8678.80	4.72
take advantage of the time left for sure	8681.16	5.6
allowed 5 to2 now as s pick up another	8683.52	4.32
round	8686.76	3.0
and just a note let's be sure we're	8687.84	4.08
cheering for the results not the buildup	8689.76	4.92
to the result to keep these players in	8691.92	4.479
the mode they need to be in and focused	8694.68	3.599
on just the	8696.40	4.681
kills good push good play sen come up	8698.28	4.401
with another round and now it's going to	8701.08	4.199
be three to three on these big time	8702.68	4.4
ultimates that that guy is definitely	8705.28	3.841
not smiling he is not smiling right now	8707.08	3.88
they're having trouble finding a way to	8709.12	3.72
break that smile we saw the other guys	8710.96	4.519
too noting	8712.84	5.8
it all right three towards a here and	8715.48	5.761
the split still from loud to prepare	8718.64	4.48
themselves for a push tens hasn't been	8721.24	3.68
able to get as much space as he did last	8723.12	3.159
time I know he keeps saying that but	8724.92	5.04
they're really really cutting him	8726.28	3.681
close it's 10's close range with the TP	8730.68	6.4
Z first Contact once again there's that	8734.44	4.321
jump spot tens is getting ready for the	8737.08	3.04
left side if there's going to be a	8738.76	3.88
rewing Les setting out for an orb late	8740.12	4.84
towards	8742.64	2.32
U-Haul already activates it up but this	8745.48	4.721
is going to be good information here for	8748.88	2.76
Sentinels cuz nobody's really moving	8750.20	3.0
behind even the boombot to try to bait	8751.64	4.4
it out Willow be ready for the position	8753.20	4.6
of where T is at at the corner when the	8756.04	5.64
TP is also gone 10 now in a position of	8757.80	7.639
a one and done well lder looking to	8761.68	5.4
activate with the N command towards the	8765.44	5.081
a site full execution coming	8767.08	5.64
through hands around the corner there's	8770.52	5.839
that first shot Les falls down Q also	8772.72	7.12
heavily as try to move out towards the	8776.36	5.92
showers and off to run it back two	8779.84	4.559
players instantly fall for Sentinels	8782.28	4.08
trying to delay trying to deny is the	8784.40	4.321
old strike coming down from zelus at 1	8786.36	4.881
HP off the PCH allowing the flank to	8788.72	3.559
happen from	8791.24	3.84
Sashi now in more delays there's 15	8792.28	4.921
seconds left Q decides to push forward	8795.08	4.16
and they flip the sight loud is now	8797.20	4.52
planning for spawn while they had the	8799.24	5.079
Rolling Thunder to work with look at	8801.72	4.92
that position you saw that KUSI ran	8804.32	4.281
through through the get position toward	8806.64	3.839
showers so this is looking really good	8808.60	3.6
for L on a pulse	8810.48	4.681
PL moving in not too much util there the	8812.20	4.44
heels are already been	8815.16	4.84
had Q nobody's going to focus on this no	8816.64	7.52
way gets it 3K for qk remember the	8820.00	6.279
ultimate was just used recently halfway	8824.16	4.72
there already can really start to flex	8826.28	4.401
into the sight and they get that	8828.88	4.04
ultimate out of Cowen Zine finally to	8830.68	4.48
make it work been holding on to that	8832.92	4.479
just to make sure it was right and they	8835.16	5.8
do collect the W 6 to2	8837.40	6.441
now loud starting to show a lot of	8840.96	5.16
confidence that we were looking for in	8843.84	5.519
the first two maps where do they	8846.12	6.359
go just a split to the right side sadak	8849.36	4.881
is going to be the one who is on the	8852.48	3.92
lurk as per usual this is the way we	8854.24	4.44
usually see it when SED Do's on the sky	8856.40	3.561
when he's on something that can info	8858.68	2.799
detect here he'll still be able to do it	8859.96	4.439
a bit with a knife and just his	8861.48	5.88
eyeballs slow push from t	8864.40	5.92
and Sentinels playing more receptive now	8867.36	4.641
to what loud is trying to put onto the	8870.32	2.801
map they aren't getting these	8872.00	3.6
extremities checked as much hooka seems	8873.12	5.8
to be very important for loud to one to	8875.60	4.92
get that to get John cue but they've	8878.92	3.68
tempted it a lot they Faultline it a lot	8880.52	4.08
just to mess with hookah exactly it	8882.60	3.0
seems as though it was something that	8884.60	2.6
SEL was trying to read on the game plan	8885.60	3.2
but we hold that thought SEL after	8887.20	4.0
losing a player trying to gain some more	8888.80	4.88
control information by contacting down	8891.20	5.96
towards long be and now they jump spot	8893.68	5.16
actually just a quick jiggle from Ze to	8897.16	3.4
see the other two they're going to have	8898.84	4.76
to Turtle back into B	8900.56	3.04
site but yeah looking at how loud likes	8904.20	5.48
to pressure towards hookah but the first	8908.04	4.239
few rounds they haven't done it SEL	8909.68	4.24
realized okay we can do the Trap plays	8912.28	4.401
with the TPS now so they let it go and	8913.92	4.439
it allows loud in round number nine to	8916.68	2.88
actually do that execution to get the	8918.36	3.361
pick but not before now the execution	8919.56	3.839
towards the aide the show stopper out	8921.72	3.88
from Z landing on the	8923.40	4.161
cow	8925.60	4.36
though once again doing some hero plays	8927.56	4.48
just inside that smoke as T walking	8929.96	3.88
through gets the execution traded out by	8932.04	4.239
zelus that showers running through the	8933.84	5.32
Molly Z gets the backstab on to Les Tu	8936.28	5.561
is now lone with the swipe down zelis	8939.16	5.199
with a drive by once again in the	8941.84	5.559
stier they're trading 3ks that's what it	8944.36	6.521
takes two 3ks in a row for qck and it's	8947.40	6.481
not going to be enough Sentinels still	8950.88	4.96
find a way through that was the Stinger	8953.88	4.88
swing as well from zelus some say he's	8955.84	4.0
still	8958.76	4.679
swinging wow dimensional drift is there	8959.84	5.0
for the next round we'll see this play	8963.44	3.201
once again just up in the face their	8964.84	3.72
opponent celus with a quick pen there to	8966.64	5.36
get the frag knowing it would come	8968.56	3.44
through Fearless play	8972.76	4.04
here we're going to have weapons on both	8976.92	4.04
sides exactly you saw from that replay	8979.04	4.239
after Kus got that pick on to 10 running	8980.96	4.359
back is available in round number	8983.28	5.561
10 last now looking really good on the	8985.32	5.841
attack haven't been fully figured out	8988.84	3.2
here by	8991.16	3.199
Sentinels as of	8992.04	4.92
yet as they're looking	8994.36	5.361
for the contact now toward short I think	8996.96	4.319
that was through smoke zelus Falls	8999.72	3.28
running back once	9001.28	3.881
again after the first kill to try to	9003.00	4.319
clear it out now they spot Zin on the	9005.16	4.72
right side of showers even utility	9007.32	4.96
pushes all the way back should allow the	9009.88	4.64
plant to come down though looking all	9012.28	4.241
the way back from the spawn here's a TP	9014.52	4.36
SE a TP and does a little bit of damage	9016.52	4.04
there onto	9018.88	3.519
sasi and he's going to be in position	9020.56	3.839
for the mly too so the post plant was	9022.40	4.561
the lurk dimensional drift inside U-Haul	9024.40	3.681
T is going to call out their three	9026.96	2.439
players in there after the shot for the	9028.08	2.96
nine they diffus but it's going to	9029.40	4.281
halfway hit by that one Bal then comes	9031.04	4.08
down for the Post Pline less with the	9033.68	4.24
shorty on the S as more flashes coming	9035.12	4.68
through but it's looking pretty good	9037.92	3.76
here for L on the pulse so far more	9039.80	5.519
shorty action oh my God the short things	9041.68	5.799
come out for loud they take the lead by	9045.32	4.08
four or they maintain the lead by four	9047.48	5.8
so far yeah cine there with his own 3K	9049.40	7.321
great play by loud loud starting to	9053.28	5.481
figure out the map to where they don't	9056.72	5.28
need their full Squad to get in so much	9058.76	5.28
different from the previous maps in this	9062.00	4.16
series you have tu's all the way back	9064.04	3.84
watching flank you still had less at	9066.16	3.76
Short a who didn't have to get into the	9067.88	4.0
fight until a little bit to when the	9069.92	5.439
spike was half really good patience and	9071.88	6.08
control here by what loud is doing once	9075.36	4.12
they're inside the site like I said	9077.96	3.28
they're doing it with even less numbers	9079.48	4.441
now cuz they're making it work so well	9081.24	4.96
so quick Molly or quick orb over that's	9083.92	4.16
going to land just about the spot right	9086.20	3.04
uh left to the wall so that's going to	9088.08	4.199
be a U-Haul orb I can make sure that	9089.24	5.52
wall doesn't leave them open once they	9092.28	5.08
get past it showers control this time	9094.76	5.0
and cine First	9097.36	5.401
Blood easy one so far I mean he used a	9099.76	5.0
lot of utility to really flush out early	9102.76	3.84
aggression knowing that sel's on the L	9104.76	3.84
by we're going to try to do something	9106.60	3.28
aggressive but the aggression came out	9108.60	3.719
from long b instead is always ready for	9109.88	6.36
these place in the last one oh	9112.32	6.441
clean look that three k is around one	9116.24	4.88
for everybody it's like a prize right	9118.76	8.32
now collected by loud in handfuls here	9121.12	8.76
tuis Al back up they're going to be able	9127.08	4.52
to figure out whatever they want for	9129.88	4.24
final round but they will receive three	9131.60	4.759
ultimates here from the side of Sentinel	9134.12	3.88
one enemy remaining if they don't go	9136.36	3.481
down on that first	9138.00	5.68
Blood loud went from slow playing kind	9139.84	6.519
of to the extremities to that round was	9143.68	4.799
cenen walking up showers to contact and	9146.36	4.481
just frag somebody like they're they're	9148.48	4.321
using it all right now and they're not	9150.84	4.559
try they're trying to keep a precedent	9152.80	4.12
out of sentinel's head they're not	9155.40	3.321
showing the same thing loud keeps	9156.92	4.439
switching it up and Sen keeps guessing	9158.72	3.88
well they're guessing right this time	9161.36	3.92
around Sadat solo into showers but he	9162.60	5.24
still gets one before before he falls	9165.28	4.641
and's going to pull some players across	9167.84	4.36
Seekers coming out confirming now that	9169.92	4.72
hook control finally comes out for	9172.20	6.04
loud ult from John cue preventing a	9174.64	5.96
split from happening aggressively for	9178.24	4.239
the attack side as	9180.60	4.28
well because they lost the	9182.48	4.281
do can't really push through they're	9184.88	3.24
going to use the orbital strike in set	9186.76	3.36
beautiful utility that spray right in	9188.12	4.48
between what a play there for L to take	9190.12	5.04
control of B	9192.60	4.96
Main	9195.16	5.0
slow okay that's heard by sashy at least	9197.56	6.32
but does Z move this is great ground to	9200.16	7.159
be gained by loud loud right now just to	9203.88	6.479
enter towards the sight sashy splits out	9207.32	6.12
the push and that's a spike down but qk	9210.36	4.481
was still there inside hook could to tra	9213.44	5.561
her right out zelis trying to count the	9214.84	5.439
timing to get through the smoke as it	9219.00	3.6
dissipates he's able to fall	9220.28	4.521
away you talked about second anchoring	9222.60	5.32
for the longest time TP true and now you	9224.80	5.2
understand when La T takes control of	9227.92	4.439
hookah it's so hard to deal against for	9230.00	3.84
the retake	9232.36	4.241
exactly even if you have B main control	9233.84	4.599
in the Octagon Garden it doesn't seem	9236.60	3.6
like it matters with what loud is going	9238.44	3.441
to start doing to push and pull you	9240.20	3.64
around that hookah around the market	9241.88	3.88
side of the map and maybe even showers	9243.84	4.72
cuz their numbers are working so	9245.76	4.96
efficiently in groups of three or four	9248.56	5.16
with that lurker still around the map	9250.72	5.52
very well done so far here by loud and	9253.72	5.28
93 hopefully could be a 93 curse for the	9256.24	5.36
SOS fans but until we start the second	9259.00	4.8
half let's toss it down to GB people	9261.60	4.56
dancing on the VCT America Stage that's	9263.80	4.16
all you need to get out of that awesome	9266.16	4.48
stuff by the two from the crowd love the	9267.96	4.76
Showmanship thanks so much for for	9270.64	3.88
coming out and making that so awesome so	9272.72	3.84
even if the loud fan won on push-ups the	9274.52	3.759
crowd was still behind to see who won	9276.56	3.4
for the series so I think it's still	9278.28	3.801
even out we don't know who's going to	9279.96	4.28
win this series yet so we'll just let	9282.08	5.08
the game decide in the piss around now	9284.24	5.8
Sentinels on the attack working out very	9287.16	5.159
slow contact to start things off at	9290.04	4.6
their default again you're seen the same	9292.32	4.12
thing though jump contacts coming out	9294.64	4.08
from L and getting ready to delay deny	9296.44	4.481
with Cen Zen theault line set up at the	9298.72	4.52
elbow but it sides otherwise to Pivot	9300.92	4.439
towards the a site and it's a great read	9303.24	3.44
so far cuz that's where sentinel's	9305.36	3.681
moving as well they are encroaching back	9306.68	4.599
to the other side of the map if you get	9309.04	4.48
that kill over towards B long G Crash	9311.28	4.281
from 10 everybody's hitting the site but	9313.52	4.68
they go back back to strp B of round one	9315.56	4.52
that's going to be the a hit not enough	9318.20	3.84
noise at B long so we go for short the	9320.08	4.88
Molly from Z now but loud ready on the	9322.04	4.56
other side for this as the smoke start	9324.96	4.479
to clear and with the orb to use the dog	9326.60	4.32
but it's towards the right side to allow	9329.44	3.681
T to move forward inside showers and	9330.92	4.32
both twinsies are working together on	9333.12	3.88
the left side of triple the right click	9335.24	4.039
classic SLE Score first in the pistol	9337.00	5.0
round sadak Falls and there's traits	9339.28	5.241
instantly all around the Spike's still	9342.00	5.6
down 30 seconds left delayed enough for	9344.52	5.0
potential backstab coming through as two	9347.60	3.52
just got spotted they saw one will they	9349.52	4.959
see two beautiful Flash coming out from	9351.12	6.319
10 but they	9354.48	2.96
both quick heal comes down to to John	9358.72	7.679
cue left side of triple gas down wall	9362.92	5.76
down as well pivot back from loud using	9366.40	4.721
all the time in their favor oh the head	9368.68	5.679
shot down to 8 HP just to try to delay	9371.12	5.56
so two is come come out of shower gets	9374.36	4.08
that pick and there's the	9376.68	4.24
trade beautifully done in a coordination	9378.44	5.601
of loud they come out for the trade and	9380.92	6.12
two will get the diffuse loud now or at	9384.04	5.08
10 and they're really trying to push	9387.04	5.52
this to the brink in that five to go to	9389.12	6.56
Lotus between these two teams as well	9392.56	4.919
one of the biggest chess games you can	9395.68	5.12
run on our three site Maps cannot wait	9397.48	5.721
cannot wait it looks like it is on the	9400.80	4.8
horizon a stinger by here from Sentinels	9403.20	5.44
we saw saw this be effective on ice box	9405.60	6.48
Can it have the same result here on bind	9408.64	5.679
loud has just been so strong Guardian in	9412.08	3.92
the hands of tu's after those frags and	9414.32	5.16
the defuse building himself up to alt	9416.00	5.84
stingers and Bulldogs around with Sak's	9419.48	6.161
judge close in hand guarding U-Haul all	9421.84	5.96
right so send flip it 10's now on the	9425.64	4.32
left side of the map to Gate Crash back	9427.80	3.84
to the right so a little bit different	9429.96	4.92
from round one but loud has no reason to	9431.64	5.4
really worri about any anything until	9434.88	3.76
Sentinels puts their full their full	9437.04	4.88
force into a sight hit trying to move	9438.64	5.24
quickly try to Pivot some players out	9441.92	4.8
the knife came out from shorty into s	9443.88	4.68
and with that it allows for L to just	9446.72	3.84
hold back for a bit but he do have	9448.56	4.24
players to try to work for utility soak	9450.56	4.48
holding as judge and SEL definitely know	9452.80	4.0
that tape so everybody's pitting towards	9455.04	3.88
the right side of ABC to try to get the	9456.80	4.36
backstab zel has just got spotted Molly	9458.92	4.96
to Molly lass to that now Pinn inside	9461.16	4.92
but the judge gets the kill second train	9463.88	4.64
right back with the Stingers Advantage	9466.08	4.04
for sels as they get the plat down	9468.52	4.2
towards the a	9470.12	2.6
site rotate	9472.88	4.64
around going be a little too late here	9475.44	4.761
for qck with the damage that Z's doing	9477.52	5.2
with the judge as he flies through sight	9480.20	4.159
picks up the Stinger once again after	9482.72	3.88
that damage has been done yeah loud got	9484.36	3.96
a piece of their own	9486.60	4.36
medicine T also winning that fight the	9488.32	5.361
Stinger meta has it	9490.96	5.96
returned one more to go it's UC K denied	9493.68	7.36
by zelis off the trade to again they do	9496.92	6.16
it again this is amazing seeing a	9501.04	3.84
stinger meta coming back from the	9503.08	3.68
Sentinels that's Kaplan at the helm	9504.88	3.519
pretty much he is the one that brought	9506.76	4.24
that up back in the day in like	9508.40	5.04
2021 what was a team name like Echo 7 or	9511.00	4.439
something with Rob whiz oh wow oh yeah	9513.44	4.04
we're going way back you're digging deep	9515.44	4.201
you're digging deep but yeah the	9517.48	5.0
Sentinels have made it work	9519.64	5.32
twice um clobbering through the site to	9522.48	4.281
get that plant down the first round	9524.96	3.56
pretty much secures the decision to want	9526.76	3.4
to buy on that second the little bit of	9528.52	4.64
extra money flowing them into a state	9530.16	4.48
where they want to rush with stingers	9533.16	3.279
and everybody behind each other makes it	9534.64	4.36
work again we see it a second time from	9536.44	5.121
Sentinels now loud has to wonder how	9539.00	5.0
they work they Low by you can expect Les	9541.56	4.52
to get some Sheriff shots in sure but	9544.00	4.24
how much damage can they do to stop sen	9546.08	4.92
from pulling back a bunch of rounds	9548.24	5.4
here this is a very similar situation as	9551.00	4.84
seen in previous Maps where the Stinger	9553.64	3.88
really allowed SEL to start building up	9555.84	3.28
a bit of that economy but La was still	9557.52	5.16
able to maintain no head	9559.12	6.44
shot just trying to go for wide swings	9562.68	5.24
after the kill the TP across now at the	9565.56	4.56
Helm of the push is T with the rest of	9567.92	4.479
SEL inside the B site should be an easy	9570.12	4.92
plan in the	9572.40	2.641
end right now it's cuses trying to keep	9575.24	4.96
them busy the other three are still	9577.80	4.08
trying to FL back deciding if they want	9580.20	4.56
a TP across or just try to fight at	9581.88	4.72
least one one player that could be	9584.76	4.2
straggling behind and that's John cutie	9586.60	6.12
waiting with that stinger in towards	9588.96	6.8
Sans safety for now is what loud chooses	9592.72	4.16
they don't want to have to clear too	9595.76	4.84
many angles on that and sadak has the	9596.88	5.599
knife how long are they going to wait	9600.60	3.12
for that well they're going to have to	9602.48	3.321
wait till next	9603.72	4.88
round yeah pretty much you could see it	9605.80	4.28
just trying to delay and trying to get	9608.60	3.28
at least one weapon and I love that it's	9610.08	3.399
also John cuy watching that plank with	9611.88	3.36
the Stinger so if they lose that one	9613.48	3.601
definitely here from loud's Camp they	9615.24	3.4
probably won't keep that Stinger unless	9617.08	3.16
you're you could probably get something	9618.64	4.12
done with that but at the same time	9620.24	5.159
though we're not only snowballing the	9622.76	6.32
economy from SEL after that for spy they	9625.40	5.841
also starting a snowball getting very	9629.08	5.92
close to these alts on the	9631.24	3.76
attack those alts could be met with a	9635.60	5.759
qck retaliate we will see getting it	9638.12	5.199
there hey sometimes it just takes a few	9641.36	4.441
bullets to calibrate okay hey that	9643.32	3.96
distance to instant pull down and get a	9645.80	2.92
shot like that that's	9647.28	4.281
sick great way to utilize that Stinger	9648.72	4.12
at that point you feel like your mouse	9651.56	3.839
is going to fall off your mouse pad 10	9652.84	5.4
to five here Sentinels starting a little	9655.40	5.641
bit of momentum we'll see if got to go	9658.24	5.92
fast is what they are thinking tens is	9661.04	4.68
going to make quick ground with a few	9664.16	4.159
steps before slamming on to	9665.72	5.04
shift they looks like it's going to be a	9668.32	3.641
quick pop	9670.76	3.679
flash seems to love doing not only a	9671.96	4.359
double flash but this time triple flash	9674.44	2.92
with a	9676.32	3.401
decoy push L away allowing the	9677.36	4.481
dimensional drift to come	9679.72	4.12
out pushing loud all the way back	9681.84	4.2
towards the spawn forcing The Defenders	9683.84	4.559
to play the	9686.04	6.52
retake quick take five towards the top	9688.40	5.481
side here for	9692.56	3.6
loud let's see where they decide to get	9693.88	3.92
in after these smokes clear because	9696.16	3.76
right now the delay is heavy from	9697.80	4.32
Sentinels qck will break the barrier	9699.92	4.6
first has to be him waiting for him to	9702.12	4.0
rotate back from the B side hit by the	9704.52	4.799
dog close range shorty denied right away	9706.12	4.72
but they get information of two players	9709.32	4.321
from C on the post m in U-Haul so for	9710.84	3.88
allow they're trying to fight back	9713.64	3.2
towards showers Sashi getting ready for	9714.72	3.8
a pop flash so they could swing back off	9716.84	3.439
the tap of the spike but there's	9718.52	4.32
theability off utility can't stick onto	9720.28	4.361
the diffuse quite yet cus gate is signed	9722.84	3.36
to move forward three players all the	9724.64	3.52
way back towards short a and the wall	9726.20	4.36
bang gets him but you saw that Molly	9728.16	3.76
that just came down there's not enough	9730.56	3.08
time here at this point and even not	9731.92	4.519
enough bodies to escape for loud	9733.64	5.4
everybody dies and sels they get round	9736.44	4.88
number six the post plant game is	9739.04	4.92
becoming so relevant here for the way	9741.32	5.761
Sentinels are playing we see John QD	9743.96	4.72
using Viper line on some different Maps	9747.08	3.64
as well here it's up to zelus to stay	9748.68	3.32
alive on these	9750.72	3.88
ones and a great push through the shower	9752.00	5.16
push we saw was actually Sentinels using	9754.60	5.24
loud smoke against them if a yoru	9757.16	5.319
bounces his flash off the floor inside a	9759.84	5.04
smoke it will pop flash right outside	9762.48	4.161
the bloom of the smoke almost impossible	9764.88	4.04
to dodge combine that with a saucy flash	9766.64	5.48
as well decoy and a decoy and Sentinels	9768.92	5.559
has answers for the defensive they're	9772.12	4.96
seeing answer right there as well	9774.48	4.201
exactly sometimes you only need utility	9777.08	3.359
just he tends to move forward and get	9778.68	2.639
that	9780.44	3.721
kill and he's going to control showers	9781.32	6.12
as the rest of SEL holding it back again	9784.16	4.92
understanding a lower by for loud in	9787.44	4.04
round number 17 fake teleport you see	9789.08	6.319
the very low buy that you currently have	9791.48	6.441
for the defensive side Crossfire set up	9795.40	5.521
with shotguns inside	9797.92	3.0
hookah it comes down now at the mid	9801.12	4.52
round for utility to be important for	9803.20	3.68
Sentinels to try to flush things out	9805.64	2.56
they have what it takes I mean the do	9806.88	5.04
the boom everything it be tough minute	9808.20	7.64
here T patience again pays off he'll	9811.92	5.72
have free alt orb here in a second if he	9815.84	4.04
wants it but more playing for the shot	9817.64	4.36
ready as they're waiting for this low by	9819.88	3.88
from loud to get antsy they start	9822.00	3.439
getting a few jiggle peaks in and that's	9823.76	3.2
just enough for S to connect with the	9825.44	2.96
crosshairs and that's the moment of	9826.96	4.12
hesitation coming from there's a minute	9828.40	4.241
left on the clock loud has no	9831.08	3.64
information of where sel's at so they	9832.64	3.56
have to start moving forward to get	9834.72	2.8
information because they also are	9836.20	3.079
playing a composition that doesn't	9837.52	3.56
really allow for them to scan anything	9839.28	3.721
out set for sadd's life it's a great	9841.08	4.199
point you don't scan you have to jump	9843.00	5.439
Peak things you sadd's not on the sky	9845.28	4.841
he's trying to hit a knife the knife can	9848.44	4.92
be dodged they cannot confirm much	9850.12	5.159
without putting themselves in danger in	9853.36	5.12
Sentinels is punishing that positioning	9855.28	5.16
every single one of those kills were	9858.48	3.92
just Sentinels posted at the right spot	9860.44	3.361
right everybody just walked into their	9862.40	3.641
cross there Peak they literally didn't	9863.80	4.44
even need to raise a finger move the	9866.04	3.439
mouse it just kept it there a whole	9868.24	3.28
round until finally tenens is trying to	9869.48	3.521
create some space and trying to find	9871.52	3.879
information and not only donates his	9873.00	5.0
life but allows for once again SEL to	9875.40	6.361
pick up here an ult that should be very	9878.00	5.359
important yeah with the dimensional	9881.76	3.4
drift for them to clear out the space	9883.36	3.241
and play the pulse plant that's been	9885.16	4.0
very good at so far I think we got a	9886.60	4.32
decent buy still for loud maybe a	9889.16	3.76
timeout call from them figuring out how	9890.92	4.08
they can start to defend what is	9892.92	3.92
happening from that side to say yep	9895.00	4.88
there it is they call through they need	9896.84	5.2
to stop the bleeding right now Sentinels	9899.88	4.76
has come up with four rounds in a lot of	9902.04	5.04
the rounds loud is not able to have	9904.64	5.04
their full member retake because they've	9907.08	4.88
been picked apart across the map of this	9909.68	5.04
default Sentinels continues to run and	9911.96	6.399
come up with so much so they they have a	9914.72	5.8
lot to throw at Sentinels here this	9918.36	4.481
could be around they get that cine	9920.52	4.64
ultimate up we've seen multi-kill rounds	9922.84	5.519
from him one after the other it's very	9925.16	4.64
possible they have three alts to fight	9928.36	3.801
back on this but Sentinels has a few on	9929.80	4.76
Deck as well this could be very chaotic	9932.16	4.159
they go back to that default Strat	9934.56	3.4
setting up at just about every point of	9936.32	3.521
the attack side to make sure loud isn't	9937.96	4.08
getting space and Sentinels we talked	9939.84	5.36
about it of loud's comp oh Sentinels	9942.04	5.84
knows that loud has to use their bodies	9945.20	4.96
to Peak they're their own sentries here	9947.88	5.479
if loud or if sadok's knife misses so	9950.16	5.08
they're always looking for these	9953.36	4.721
shots they're about to go for a four	9955.24	6.199
player hit towards the long B sign so	9958.08	4.84
with the initial noise that they made	9961.44	4.401
towards shers was an instant TP from T A	9962.92	5.76
jiggle now spotting a couple but it's	9965.84	5.12
instantly traed too many parties to deal	9968.68	5.0
against Les gets taken down and that's	9970.96	5.359
wall did	9973.68	5.36
Smoke's too far away to try to smoke it	9976.32	4.04
back out so it gives a chance now for	9979.04	3.359
Sentinels to move inside that sight	9980.36	3.521
that's why 10 gave his life away so he	9982.40	2.96
can have a dimensional to drift this	9983.88	2.88
round	9985.36	3.841
over allows sasi to get the plant and	9986.76	5.44
Seekers on top of it not yet cuz it gets	9989.20	4.96
denied from the after shot from elbow	9992.20	3.239
orbital strike but he's going to stick	9994.16	2.72
it	9995.44	4.84
still no Seekers there's a flank coming	9996.88	5.12
that could be huge right there cus	10000.28	3.601
getting the pick the execution onto	10002.00	4.6
zelus no coming out up to 10 of Don cue	10003.88	6.36
now up to 10 only and they cannot hold	10006.60	6.719
it took a while but seems as a loud	10010.24	5.119
finally were able to answer back on	10013.32	5.721
Sentinels po plant protocols team I like	10015.36	6.201
it from loud they split up the flashes	10019.04	4.6
they split up the aggressive entry and	10021.56	5.08
how it can hit the site and q's Thanos	10023.64	4.96
timing at long didn't even require any	10026.64	4.48
flashes he Peaks he kills and the rest	10028.60	4.52
of the team of loud is able to come	10031.12	4.12
through they did get that orbital strike	10033.12	4.68
out and Cen Zen does pick up the Rolling	10035.24	5.079
Thunder was we expected on that round so	10037.80	4.559
they can now fold over this power into	10040.32	4.281
another Victory to bring it to game	10042.36	4.801
Point again Sentinel still has quite a	10044.60	4.52
bit in the pocket for this round with	10047.16	5.84
ultimates in Z and zelus and	10049.12	3.88
Sai crash down a walk down down with	10054.32	7.721
Brimstone as well not even that	10058.64	7.24
speed it just went with a Brim St	10062.04	6.439
flash taking control of B instant	10065.88	4.76
rotating but with that look at SEL they	10068.48	4.88
haven't budged at all loud's been very	10070.64	5.24
Pro proactive rather with this type of	10073.36	6.04
composition on their defensive	10075.88	3.519
signs imagine imagine they find	10080.28	5.04
something there right L's protocol is to	10082.92	5.479
just fight a war at Fountain it be long	10085.32	4.721
Sentinels are now going to try to rehit	10088.40	3.96
this area to see just how much came down	10090.04	5.319
and qk out of it first Blood pretends	10092.36	5.881
there allow Seekers to come out too to	10095.36	4.241
force to rotate even that Rolling	10098.24	3.199
Thunder you mentioned before from cine	10099.60	4.24
it's pinned towards that b site and now	10101.44	5.04
it's R by loud that small Split Second	10103.84	6.16
saw the TP heard the TP so SEL now have	10106.48	6.481
to at least try to gain some ground loud	10110.00	4.6
trying to be ready for this one but SEL	10112.96	3.24
also post it up so they can TP away if	10114.60	3.879
they need to should Z not get the picks	10116.20	4.8
with a sh stopper and you don't expect	10118.48	5.401
the timing Les does look inside the	10121.00	4.6
smoke though Sak gets the tra back off	10123.88	3.92
the S second pushing all the way forward	10125.60	3.679
a double towards the back of the sight	10127.80	4.599
he does get the first pick up	10129.28	3.12
the the TB came across like they wanted	10132.68	6.36
to for Sentinels loud eating into the	10135.84	5.559
strategy eating into the bait and we'll	10139.04	4.76
have S pstat now towards the be site and	10141.40	5.281
there's a bit of the Singler Pro play	10143.80	5.32
from each one of them strength coming	10146.68	6.2
out and some Allstars there now up to	10149.12	6.96
cenen great shot captain I it's going to	10152.88	4.64
be a tough one to get this down with	10156.08	3.359
what what's going to be happening	10157.52	3.28
obviously he just looks for the exit	10159.44	2.721
kills that's going to happen to him but	10160.80	3.76
with 10's coming around on the outside	10162.16	5.239
of this round his teleport from B gate	10164.56	5.96
crashed into spawn so Les had an inkling	10167.40	4.681
yeah there's going to be a Teleport but	10170.52	3.48
maybe it's a little bit later and tens	10172.08	3.399
finally found that timing even though	10174.00	4.479
Les did look it just shows you just how	10175.48	5.481
patient sends pushing forward how much	10178.48	4.161
they're making loud have to consider	10180.96	3.92
this angle or this when loud just wants	10182.64	4.679
to be watching the sight take and and	10184.88	5.12
denying another kill for cenen as we're	10187.32	4.601
get to teleport out of zelis searching a	10190.00	3.2
little blood in the water but they	10191.92	4.64
cannot take him down cin still been	10193.20	4.96
doing a very good job getting a lot of	10196.56	4.2
value out of these fault lines to not	10198.16	4.44
only set up himself but his teammates	10200.76	3.12
but the amount of times we saw I think	10202.60	3.679
it was twice in this series so far we	10203.88	4.84
was able to get a fa line Aftershock	10206.28	5.801
combination to get picks get kills so	10208.72	7.84
utility is still quite good here for Lou	10212.08	6.239
but again it it comes down to that story	10216.56	3.28
line on that second half on that four	10218.32	3.201
spy Stinger that we had from Sentinels	10219.84	3.2
allowing for them to pick up four rounds	10221.52	3.48
in a row now finally going back and	10223.04	5.359
forth loud still in the lead by three	10225.00	5.439
10's looking for showers control solo	10228.40	3.121
with the	10230.44	3.641
shorty flash being initiated down	10231.52	5.08
towards long B though for Sentinels to	10234.08	4.08
try to see if somebody's going to try to	10236.60	4.879
tap an orb trying to deny it away from	10238.16	6.279
qck but he's got two he with him shoots	10241.48	5.361
first first tp's away and he's gone now	10244.44	3.721
they have to worry I mean they heard the	10246.84	3.8
TP was it fake you're going to leave one	10248.16	4.44
they can at least clear out and start to	10250.64	4.52
lean the other way calls from loud are	10252.60	4.24
going to say be Long's getting hit right	10255.16	4.119
now so just be sturdy in your positions	10256.84	4.559
cine starts them off great way to be	10259.28	4.801
stury the head shot through a couple of	10261.40	4.241
walls dropping	10264.08	4.12
one right now Sentinels are trying to	10265.64	5.08
move in towards this B site baiting out	10268.20	5.32
util baiting out the Aftershock first	10270.72	4.559
potentially even the rolling Thunder as	10273.52	3.839
louder all towards the back of that site	10275.28	5.641
trying to wall bang off the tap John cue	10277.36	5.281
getting the plant and also getting the	10280.92	4.2
pit activates it on the top of the B	10282.64	5.0
site but remember qk meanwhile picked up	10285.12	4.56
the orb on showers so they have Rolling	10287.64	4.56
Thunder and run it back to try to go	10289.68	4.719
directly against this here it comes	10292.20	4.48
right now as qk leads the charge looking	10294.40	3.601
through trying to spat some players	10296.68	3.4
there's the headshot onto John cutie pit	10298.00	4.479
will now come down more information as T	10300.08	5.159
inside the Smoke traed Out by there's	10302.48	5.121
only one player left at celsus fully	10305.24	5.481
flash does get the back the two a two	10307.60	5.08
versus one only as it's going to work	10310.72	5.08
with almost got the clutch but Tu was	10312.68	5.599
there for the trade the	10315.80	7.88
diffuse and L will be at that point game	10318.28	8.521
five Lotus on the horizon loud's time	10323.68	6.24
out paying dividends a few rounds ago to	10326.80	5.12
find a way to get the brimstone ultimate	10329.92	4.16
in then a few rounds later the Rolling	10331.92	5.559
Thunder in and now the retake on the	10334.08	6.92
site again loud find success they stay	10337.48	5.401
alive one enemy remaining and they have	10341.00	4.52
a chance to push us once more to our	10342.88	4.88
final map still a lot of chances four	10345.52	5.919
even for send to get to the OT here loud	10347.76	5.679
almost has this one locked down but you	10351.44	3.8
cannot give it to anyone just yet with	10353.44	3.561
the way they've been playing See How	10355.24	3.481
They jump into this next round where	10357.00	3.2
they're going what they're doing 10's	10358.72	3.719
ready off the rip for dimensional drift	10360.20	3.8
and he's going to start just throwing	10362.44	3.721
out in to the team here we'll see how	10364.00	4.16
loud reacts you got money to work with	10366.16	4.119
here for s in round number 21 Back	10368.16	3.76
Against The Wall spotting sadak inside	10370.28	5.481
U-Haul M to P to push them back they try	10371.92	5.559
to regain control Les has a judge but	10375.76	4.2
he's towards the bide qck and two	10377.48	6.441
holding the a site down off Dien drift	10379.96	6.12
information trying to get utility behind	10383.92	4.84
and sprays behind it it's actually loud	10386.08	4.92
that capitalizes on all of these kills	10388.76	5.679
tens alone against the world how bad you	10391.00	5.84
guys want a	10394.44	2.401
computer TS a lot of work ahead of him	10397.52	6.68
here and I'm sure Kaplan is looking at	10401.16	6.48
the Lotus Notes at this point what a	10404.20	7.0
great two maps from loud incredibly hard	10407.64	6.32
fought on the last map of ice box that	10411.20	5.32
was such a back and forth he does get	10413.96	4.76
the first Contact still 40 seconds to	10416.52	4.28
work with doesn't have any more gate	10418.72	4.0
crashes so he can't really come through	10420.80	3.76
walking through the snake bite as well	10422.72	3.96
yeah and that's going to make it even	10424.56	5.44
more difficult coming out from Les judge	10426.68	5.36
inside T dancing around the corner of	10430.00	4.68
that pit walks in right now to pick it	10432.04	5.279
up no way as he walks across the TP	10434.68	5.44
though waiting is it going to get	10437.32	5.361
cleared across they didn't see him he	10440.12	5.44
made it through this 14 seconds left T	10442.68	6.2
chases him down we will be going into a	10445.56	6.36
final map to decide the winner of he's	10448.88	5.0
not scared of taking the entire Team B	10451.92	5.08
for around loud's going to have to be	10453.88	6.04
ready for that looks like that Spike may	10457.00	5.64
actually Trend towards that	10459.92	5.479
area and they do get a bit of Mount not	10462.64	5.2
Mount control but Rubble control on that	10465.40	5.08
left side with a Guiding Light to start	10467.84	5.04
no big commitment just yet for loud they	10470.48	5.321
do Peak them oh but TW is still there	10472.88	5.04
the third player door opening as well so	10475.80	3.559
they're trying to pinch in trying to	10477.92	3.6
Pivot between C or B depending where the	10479.36	4.201
picks are going to be from Sentinels	10481.52	4.52
it's on the C side to decide as three	10483.56	5.0
players fall for loud plant coming in	10486.04	4.199
kadine trying to get a for position	10488.56	3.679
trying to catch one off guard and Sak on	10490.24	4.641
the flank instantly we have a 2v2 c PIV	10492.24	4.321
towards the back gets the head shot as	10494.88	4.519
well allowing sedak to win against s the	10496.56	5.52
old teammates going head to-head Susy	10499.40	5.0
reposition around the Trailblazer	10502.08	3.92
swinging out the long range of the	10504.40	5.201
frenzy does not connect and s's ghost	10506.00	6.12
neither Oria with the ghost here moving	10509.60	5.36
forward now the re swing out from SED H	10512.12	4.6
being thrown knowing that he towards the	10514.96	5.04
back up towards the air the shot from	10516.72	6.84
above SOS get the pistol incredible	10520.00	6.479
Movement by Sashi sadok always buys a	10523.56	5.08
frenzy in a one V one situation there	10526.48	3.601
he's closing the	10528.64	4.839
distance sashy creates more sadak closes	10530.08	6.159
the distance Sashi creates more stays	10533.48	4.161
out of the range of the frenzy gets the	10536.24	4.24
ghost kill Sentinels have round one and	10537.64	5.16
that is a modified gun round strp for	10540.48	5.201
Sentinels that will usually see Z by	10542.80	6.2
himself at door opening it once be long	10545.68	6.12
has made contact they went two and two	10549.00	4.92
to make sure zin's Excursion into the	10551.80	5.559
doorway was not tainted by any B defense	10553.92	6.12
from loud crazy stuff by Sentinels there	10557.36	4.88
to modify that make it work for a pistol	10560.04	5.68
round loud now losing one already yeah	10562.24	5.561
losing one that b main Peak again	10565.72	5.36
Sentinels F A score there and 10's	10567.80	5.24
getting pretty hurt from that situation	10571.08	4.76
o good tra back to just just chip damage	10573.04	4.239
being traded but this is benefiting	10575.84	4.36
Sentinels obviously goes long range so	10577.28	6.641
zelis is still semi healthy 63 HP as	10580.20	6.079
Sentinels after the initial kill reset	10583.92	4.68
back towards C we'll get the same	10586.28	4.441
scenario this time with no more bodies	10588.60	4.04
up for	10590.72	4.4
loud Z trying to get the long range	10592.64	4.04
couldn't work it with the singer uses a	10595.12	4.4
classic instead back and forth we go	10596.68	5.28
though with a fault line timing Bucky	10599.52	4.839
close range John cutie standing not that	10601.96	5.399
t had his back but at least has the	10604.36	5.96
trade qck the only thing that he has now	10607.36	5.281
is a	10610.32	2.321
classic trying to find the opportunity	10613.00	4.2
moment to walk inside the smoke the	10615.00	4.92
backup from tens the turn around and	10617.20	4.199
then both of them swinging from	10619.92	4.08
extremities Well Done by Sentinels an	10621.40	4.88
opportunity there for loud to get the	10624.00	5.239
upset but Sentinels convert from their	10626.28	6.281
pistol loud again playing this	10629.24	6.0
composition that a little bit with their	10632.56	4.56
bodies obviously two is pushing there to	10635.24	3.361
get map control and see if they could	10637.12	2.96
have started to lean but now they do	10638.60	3.679
have sadak with guiding lights they	10640.08	4.279
don't have to go as crazy so we'll see	10642.28	4.96
what this gun round brings	10644.36	5.721
us like wait a minute that was a little	10647.24	5.08
too close for my comfort says Kaplan	10650.08	3.68
it's been a long night and a long day	10652.32	2.881
for the	10653.76	5.08
coach all right our first one towards	10655.20	5.96
rubble a wide swing to the orb didn't	10658.84	4.0
even come up Zin gets the surprise kill	10661.16	3.56
onto kaaden	10662.84	4.399
knowing that the other one was behind	10664.72	5.88
the boxes but tped away that's two e	10667.24	5.601
forced to Anchor solo a double push from	10670.60	4.6
loud to try to flank around towards C	10672.84	3.92
that will be bit by utility in a couple	10675.20	3.88
of seconds as zelis moves forward with	10676.76	3.719
the rest of the	10679.08	4.92
team this flank is huge exactly and	10680.48	4.92
actually as zelis is moving forward	10684.00	4.08
there's no alarm bot it's not really	10685.40	4.601
activated here's that timing moving	10688.08	3.68
forward now as there you go moved back	10690.00	4.2
towards the doorway alarm bot came up	10691.76	5.08
and that spots at least one player SEL	10694.20	5.96
are now ready for the backstab John CU	10696.84	4.76
is the one that greets him on the corner	10700.16	4.72
of the Boxes by baby door one-onone that	10701.60	5.16
situation door opening forward SEL are	10704.88	3.8
looking pretty good here in round number	10706.76	5.24
three their bonus Les dancing around the	10708.68	5.44
peak up from zelus at Rubble the push	10712.00	5.479
towards the spawn from z a sentinal	10714.12	6.56
score the Flawless what are they doing	10717.48	5.241
they keep opening the door they still	10720.68	4.12
got the flank and they're just playing	10722.72	4.16
games out here right now as loud tries	10724.80	5.08
to get back into the site and Loud was	10726.88	5.2
having trouble sedak threw one of his	10729.88	4.24
his flashes it link stairs and it just	10732.08	3.8
found itself going into the wall because	10734.12	3.239
it was tried to be thrown through a	10735.88	4.2
smoke little things not working for loud	10737.36	3.92
that they would have gained a bit of	10740.08	4.8
ground and Sentinels just biting back	10741.28	7.681
let's go zelis absolutely feeling it out	10744.88	5.72
of his chair right now with the hype	10748.96	3.96
from the crowd and we're in ground gun	10750.60	3.96
round or round four I should say guns	10752.92	5.64
for S not for loud and Sentinels worried	10754.56	5.6
that this could be a round of trickery	10758.56	3.36
leave the spike in spawn for now as they	10760.16	4.48
do a bit of Recon the first push though	10761.92	4.88
from TU here on loud yeah and did so	10764.64	3.88
with the Recon prowling towards the B	10766.80	5.28
main as well did catch a player and as	10768.52	5.44
they go for the swing on Mound they once	10772.08	3.64
again see the Viper set up towards that	10773.96	3.0
Seas	10775.72	3.12
site and definitely here as you're	10776.96	5.12
seeing SEL working that map quite	10778.84	5.72
well zels is standing up at the end of	10782.08	5.88
these rounds also is the hype men that	10784.56	5.6
you need for SOS to try to close this	10787.96	4.96
map number five wow yeah really we're	10790.16	4.52
showing the respect to loud showstopper	10792.92	3.8
coming out creating that space on the	10794.68	3.96
Low by that you have and cine somehow	10796.72	4.84
manages to slip through the execution of	10798.64	5.56
Sentinels to get one pick with his Bucky	10801.56	4.44
nonetheless little plant will still come	10804.20	4.8
down honestly show stopper in you know	10806.00	4.6
sadok's not going to be too close with	10809.00	3.72
the judge if he has one that round yeah	10810.60	3.719
you're right playing it safe playing it	10812.72	2.84
strong and they're looking to deny the	10814.32	3.881
audio on the retake too yeah that's	10815.56	4.839
going to hit So Many Bodies even all	10818.20	5.6
four of them towards this B site all La	10820.40	5.04
could do right now is just hold the back	10823.80	3.08
waiting for that to dissipate the Wall	10825.44	3.281
comes up thankfully because Les is still	10826.88	3.559
alive big curve ball the double swing	10828.72	4.44
out of it Sashi is going to fall trying	10830.44	4.721
to play the pul plan here tuis jumps up	10833.16	4.119
on the ledge starts to fuse instantly we	10835.16	4.199
get the sprays on two kills Q then	10837.28	3.561
swinging out there's not going to be	10839.36	3.721
enough time left John CU is just staying	10840.84	4.2
alive and trying to force out Les	10843.08	5.04
towards him Les falls back Spike will	10845.04	5.96
explode the round for	10848.12	6.119
Sentinels four for S they do go down to	10851.00	5.84
one member but the coffers are full	10854.24	4.24
they've got so much money from the first	10856.84	5.04
four rounds here the ultimates to come	10858.48	5.76
up but we'll see this round again	10861.88	5.16
pressuring into the sight you can see	10864.24	5.561
that Sentinels is not kidding around	10867.04	5.6
show stoer on a low by round for	10869.80	5.88
loud they are securing these imagine if	10872.64	4.52
they didn't show stopper it came down to	10875.68	3.96
a One V one the site might have had a	10877.16	4.079
different play all the way through that	10879.64	4.12
round fist bus all around zis as well	10881.24	4.921
still in his first two maps remember we	10883.76	4.8
definitely saw a one-sided Affair for	10886.16	5.119
Sentinels as well so L seems like they	10888.56	4.799
might be digging deep right now to	10891.28	4.521
answer back on their defensive half this	10893.36	4.481
becomes interesting right it's not the	10895.80	3.92
the Rays and the fade nade here coming	10897.84	4.12
from loud so this is more of a firefight	10899.72	5.44
util hit but send can run out and answer	10901.96	4.439
right they're not too deterred from	10905.16	2.84
making this happen unless they get	10906.40	3.161
nailed by that fault	10908.00	4.359
line it's already coming out TP went	10909.56	5.24
forward though look at 10 double TP on	10912.36	6.161
both ends but's winning that one low HP	10914.80	6.72
door being opened sedak forced to fall	10918.52	5.28
back flash to try to get information the	10921.52	4.52
prowler fall right behind his second for	10923.80	5.559
three in the round a sight open for	10926.04	7.08
business and sels shuts down the defense	10929.36	6.481
I won't it's impossible but you just saw	10933.12	4.92
how hard it is for loud to actually	10935.84	4.519
control that space with the majority of	10938.04	4.199
the util they wanted to take it two	10940.36	3.561
members of Sentinels able to shut that	10942.24	5.841
down as tens and Zen go forward now they	10943.92	6.28
play the plant game all in tree they	10948.08	3.359
should be able to trade each other here	10950.20	2.88
but a good fault line could pick up a	10951.44	3.641
few does enough damage though for the	10953.08	4.52
assist last one now spotted snake by not	10955.08	4.239
allowing Les to move even more forward	10957.60	3.839
behind that two versus one second SN by	10959.32	5.441
Nanos two toxic and second dinosaur	10961.44	5.721
coming down wasting all of that time	10964.76	4.04
counter moving forward to tap on the	10967.16	3.64
spike one has to run across easy kill	10968.80	3.639
Crosshair placement but zelus knows	10970.80	4.16
better then swings that off the timing	10972.44	8.0
five now four Sentinels Crow behind him	10974.96	7.8
ascal continue to build the confidence	10980.44	4.401
in the final map and these rounds are a	10982.76	3.92
bloodbath loud's not getting the chance	10984.84	3.479
to save neither as send but they're	10986.68	3.36
coming up with the frags they're coming	10988.32	4.04
up with the round wins and John Cy is	10990.04	5.12
currently sitting on nine ,000 credits	10992.36	4.161
they can be buying each other if they	10995.16	3.119
want to they're staying away from an	10996.52	4.759
operator Sentinels is keeping a	10998.28	6.721
fastpac game to not let loud breathe	11001.28	7.08
right now loud into a big Sheriff	11005.00	5.64
guardian and vandel	11008.36	4.641
round they're stretching the money fin	11010.64	4.48
here and they go again for Rubble play	11013.00	3.52
keep doing it why not but this time	11015.12	3.0
we're answering back for loud lots of	11016.52	2.959
utility to try to clear back towards	11018.12	2.96
Rubble two is moving forward that's the	11019.48	4.041
sher's going to work now for loud and	11021.08	5.359
ring back is Assi but they pull back	11023.52	4.879
from it dropping a spike in the process	11026.44	3.84
it comes down to the men right here the	11028.40	4.561
hype man that made it Behind Enemy Lines	11030.28	4.881
and is trying to catch to	11032.96	5.479
rotate they refin the hit said it	11035.16	4.84
wouldn't be	11038.44	5.04
impossible too late the pick from zelus	11040.00	5.84
opening it up up towards the a site so	11043.48	4.88
they can pitch towards the rubble but	11045.84	3.96
the backs side's about to come forward	11048.36	3.96
from Les but he lost Kena the process	11049.80	5.28
the jump for it backstab they on to	11052.32	5.721
zelus spike El is picked up by John Cy	11055.08	5.68
with the pit available Viper on viper	11058.04	5.6
both pits also available comes down to	11060.76	4.32
who has the better read the better	11063.64	5.16
positioning it's John	11065.08	3.72
cuy absurd momentum right now electric	11070.92	8.64
from Sentinels the players are feeling	11076.60	5.36
it and they are delivering it to each	11079.56	4.4
other in these moments as well	11081.96	5.56
what a round loud again refined the a	11083.96	6.24
rubble hit they get it right but the	11087.52	5.759
round still goes in the favor of s as	11090.20	5.84
they're able to organize a hell of a	11093.28	5.2
flank to come in and completely pick	11096.04	4.239
apart loud four ultimates now ready for	11098.48	3.88
loud here three for Sentinels an	11100.28	4.721
explosive Round Here on round seven as	11102.36	5.161
the Odin unleashes from zela's hands	11105.00	4.2
they want to keep doing it for loud they	11107.52	4.32
had some sort of result there for the	11109.20	4.36
control they had towards Rob but the	11111.84	3.28
thing is they had a lower bu this time	11113.56	3.879
they wanted to do it with weapons SEL	11115.12	3.52
could have been lucky with the spray	11117.44	4.04
from zelus from the a entrance but that	11118.64	4.36
means you have no Defenders towards the	11121.48	3.92
seaside allowing for SEL to be exactly	11123.00	4.359
where they P it up at the beginning of	11125.40	4.241
this round Open up The Kill on to Le SCH	11127.36	5.161
stoer in does not get the contact Q is	11129.64	5.04
just around the corner run it back out	11132.52	4.36
and activated big curveball the head	11134.68	4.88
shot on to T Rolling Thunder also	11136.88	5.479
available here for cine and it's just to	11139.56	4.679
try to push them back back and allowing	11142.36	4.321
Kus to move forward for another pick	11144.24	3.721
lock down available at the beginning of	11146.68	3.12
this round for zelus as they had to	11147.96	4.84
reset regroup and	11149.80	3.0
rethink this would be a wild round they	11152.96	4.6
lose less first and are able to answer	11155.44	4.441
back now loud going to win this one from	11157.56	5.48
a 4v5 conversion possibly they correctly	11159.88	6.04
rotate and the just the ruse they're	11163.04	4.199
going to be sticking together though so	11165.92	3.08
it doesn't matter oh it does you're	11167.24	3.721
right it does they second guess it and	11169.00	3.08
now they're going to be rotating	11170.96	3.84
together power in number but the wrong	11172.08	5.72
sight and now it has to come down to a	11174.80	5.16
perfect timing from Sassi The Flash	11177.80	3.96
actually did not spot zelis he hears the	11179.96	4.16
footsteps once Sassi gets this plant	11181.76	4.88
it'll pull the rotate back but celsus is	11184.12	4.8
overthinking it over peing and gets Den	11186.64	6.12
n right away SP planted sashy had this	11188.92	6.16
chance before on Sunset that was the	11192.76	5.639
wingman plant we saw when he was on the	11195.08	5.6
gecko does he have the timing here to	11198.40	3.92
get behind his opponents hearing the	11200.68	3.96
audio hearing the the Stampede of loud	11202.32	5.08
go by him a Deja Vu here's the footsteps	11204.64	5.92
but this time the dreams been learn been	11207.40	7.201
read but Sassi wakes up Cene a two	11210.56	7.08
versus one paranoia hits him trying to	11214.60	4.839
get the spray across at least gets that	11217.64	4.36
second kill but L will get the diffuse	11219.44	4.8
loud find it they need this round	11222.00	3.84
Sentinel still has so much money but	11224.24	3.761
loud needed to stop the bleeding they	11225.84	4.08
were hemorrhaging rounds one after the	11228.00	4.0
other ultimates are ready for Sentinels	11229.92	3.92
so they may as well they might just take	11232.00	4.08
this back in their favor with what they	11233.84	4.88
have liking be with this setup we've	11236.08	4.84
seen them hit B with Nightfall with what	11238.72	4.16
they have and T can really mess around	11240.92	4.92
with a spawn TP if he gets it what a	11242.88	5.479
round from	11245.84	5.599
loud playing that one together rotating	11248.36	4.721
correct but they know they have a long	11251.44	3.081
road ahead of them to collect the rest	11253.08	3.399
of these rounds in the first half here's	11254.52	3.28
that b hit we were talking about from	11256.48	4.88
Sentinels not afraid to just send	11257.80	3.559
it rare hit toward towards that b site	11261.44	4.321
that paranoia is going to Blind too but	11264.12	3.56
close range still gets the kill with the	11265.76	4.16
guardian Q also moving forward After	11267.68	5.04
Shock forcing SEL to push forward but	11269.92	4.92
it's traed back and forth send back on	11272.72	4.96
the board two's answering right back pit	11274.84	5.24
is down counter coming out of Defenders	11277.68	5.12
less at low HP though K CU still at full	11280.08	4.92
with	11282.80	2.2
armor it's like sherber let's go oh a	11286.40	6.801
shot outside John cutie finds one as he	11290.64	5.679
one enemy remaining oneon-one though Les	11293.20	5.239
has that snake bite John cuy playing all	11296.32	4.801
the way on the outside Ling that pit	11298.44	5.721
down Les doing the same wall up tap on	11301.12	5.96
the spike John cue the sprays on the	11304.16	4.64
first it's halfway a little bit of a tap	11307.08	3.399
trying to stick it it's going to release	11308.80	4.32
it now gets the kill tries to go back	11310.48	5.321
for the diffuse will he get it he will	11313.12	6.44
not last in a second but John Cy wins	11315.80	5.519
the one one	11319.56	4.36
71 Sentinels	11321.32	5.441
up they pull it back in their favor we	11323.92	5.8
talked about the be hit how hard it is	11326.76	5.28
once you get that night fall in the	11329.72	4.2
close members on the defensive side	11332.04	4.76
playing B cannot orchestrate around any	11333.92	5.28
audio they're deafened they're trying to	11336.80	4.4
play off full reaction and that usually	11339.20	3.159
means you're getting met with the	11341.20	3.119
utility that follows up after the	11342.36	4.88
Nightfall and you are falling what	11344.32	6.521
around good pressure good play 710 here	11347.24	6.24
it's going to be a low by again for loud	11350.84	4.399
which means sen should be able to pick	11353.48	3.281
up this	11355.24	4.441
round as we say that though Cowen Zen's	11356.76	4.44
been getting a lot of value out of this	11359.68	3.04
Bucky so far slipping through towards	11361.20	3.119
the seaside hits and the sheriff has	11362.72	6.0
always been really good on qck less and	11364.32	8.281
tues walking towards qck our Sentinels	11368.72	5.44
after doing some initial noise towards	11372.60	3.0
the	11374.16	3.96
site do they grab Mound control now	11375.60	4.32
though yes perfect from loud they can	11378.12	3.4
start to move the rest of the map here	11379.92	3.479
they need to get a faster read on	11381.52	3.52
Sentinels the retake from loud is	11383.40	3.601
amazing with their flashes they got to	11385.04	3.88
be in position the dog came out too	11387.00	3.399
control towards Mound there is that	11388.92	4.12
instant rotate from Cowen Zen and sedak	11390.40	4.321
all the rest of the team they're still	11393.04	5.439
under a minute qy under initial	11394.72	6.44
pressure orb now being picked up Pain's	11398.48	4.361
moving forward juus gets the wall bang	11401.16	3.76
it's a bait for the bucket move forward	11402.84	3.84
but second was ready for that one cull	11404.92	4.439
under right tried to look for the safety	11406.68	4.92
John C is able to make it back but SED	11409.36	4.721
pinches from the back	11411.60	5.24
3v3 but once again the better buy is for	11414.08	4.48
the attacker sasi pushing forward	11416.84	5.399
against d a plant safe now towards the	11418.56	5.32
right side of the sight Sak got a	11422.24	4.841
Guardian guardian picked up Les moving	11423.88	4.8
forward watching their angles jumping	11427.08	3.48
out Guardian shot does not connect and	11428.68	4.84
instantly both players of Val fall with	11430.56	5.879
the crossfire set up from the Sentinels	11433.52	5.44
dominating now the attacking side	11436.44	4.641
dominating just like he did on the first	11438.96	5.24
two maps of Sentinels they're definitely	11441.08	4.319
really looking like they're running	11444.20	3.64
towards the victory of this final map	11445.40	4.08
this is	11447.84	4.559
incredible right now from Sentinels one	11449.48	6.321
enemy remaining we always pray sadak the	11452.40	7.04
five games the long uous process of	11455.80	5.76
having to restat every map figure out	11459.44	3.8
your opponents he's been there he's done	11461.56	4.719
that amazing to see how Sentinels is	11463.24	5.12
molding to the situation John cue	11466.28	4.681
continues to call well and we know zelus	11468.36	4.12
just on the back side of those calls	11470.96	3.96
adding so much information and SEL could	11472.48	4.321
do whatever they want right now can	11474.92	3.2
they're going back into that pressure	11476.80	2.8
towards the rubble sign we're like okay	11478.12	2.92
well when we have these big gun rounds	11479.60	3.0
they might try to pressure on that side	11481.04	3.6
SEL could work now the B moving back	11482.60	4.0
towards C and this is pistol repeat	11484.64	4.4
right this is exactly what Sentinel did	11486.60	4.92
on pistol round it's a a sure grab on	11489.04	4.319
orb now they pick up the spike and they	11491.52	4.36
can decide what they want to do haven't	11493.36	4.241
had to worry about this a rubble	11495.88	4.399
pressure at all really they just let it	11497.60	3.96
happen and make sure they watch the	11500.28	4.361
flank looking forward now s has only but	11501.56	5.96
what's in front of them for this B take	11504.64	4.599
having John cutie with the spike back	11507.52	3.04
there makes me think this isn't a full	11509.24	3.16
hit though a this is big right now for	11510.56	4.32
Lou you had Sadat we talked about agents	11512.40	4.121
that needs to get information he dogged	11514.88	4.24
out at the 115 then goes for Seekers at	11516.52	4.36
the one minute even to run it back to	11519.12	3.199
try to get the late round and even the	11520.88	4.68
pick onto zelus denied by John cuy still	11522.32	4.801
an opportunity here for Sentinels to	11525.56	2.839
Pivot away if they want to and it's	11527.12	3.84
starting here sash is moving forward but	11528.40	5.321
is waited by Tu for the rest is just	11530.96	6.24
second throwing the pain shells cat them	11533.72	5.24
moving up towards the B site for a plant	11537.20	4.84
SAU sashy solo clears haunt right on a	11538.96	5.359
rubble pushes back with the Seas and	11542.04	4.0
again there's still an audible to be	11544.32	3.641
called here from Sentinels they haven't	11546.04	3.96
finished to where they're going it might	11547.96	4.04
be B in the end though yeah 14 seconds	11550.00	3.12
left it's now coming in towards this	11552.00	2.64
bite but there's still players here four	11553.12	2.96
players looking to flood back from loud	11554.64	3.56
in the back of the forward position from	11556.08	4.64
Sassi on the top of the heavens winning	11558.20	3.68
just behind the smoke here's the	11560.72	3.24
footsteps root across on the back of the	11561.88	3.8
spawn now as it dissipates there the	11563.96	3.279
contact paranoia was a little bit too	11565.68	3.48
late H then moves forth though and two	11567.24	4.481
answer is right back it's back and forth	11569.16	5.8
a Congo line of kills but the advantage	11571.72	6.12
for allow door opening qck looking for	11574.96	4.72
the flank clearing out the front B both	11577.84	3.439
players of senal anchoring inside the	11579.68	3.36
side the curveball turned away by John	11581.28	4.04
cu the ads for the train second now	11583.04	4.16
Satchel available to try to get the	11585.32	3.92
diffuser off the plant but he's going to	11587.20	4.64
swing out first and knows now that they	11589.24	4.881
have to commit two are is ready for it	11591.84	4.2
though and fights back allowing loud to	11594.12	4.92
get to the fuse what a necessary round	11596.04	4.84
and they actually Focus two ultimate	11599.04	4.16
there he will get it prioritizing a b of	11600.88	4.68
the map control being able to get tuis	11603.20	4.32
pushed up on a rubble and then	11605.56	5.4
teleported into a retake for the team if	11607.52	6.44
necessary loud a very much needed round	11610.96	4.96
every single one of these last rounds	11613.96	4.16
needs to be theirs with the pressure	11615.92	4.88
Sentinels is adding to this Fifth and	11618.12	5.04
final map of the Grand Final	11620.80	5.96
two more rounds a possibility	11623.16	3.6
here size of	11627.08	7.0
relief and now they focus on another	11630.00	7.88
round any alts on Deck not really for	11634.08	4.76
for	11637.88	3.08
loud but they are going to go ahead take	11638.84	3.84
that Rubble control and try to just get	11640.96	3.519
a better read on Sentinels they need	11642.68	3.84
every bit of the beginning of these	11644.48	4.681
rounds in their favor loud does so	11646.52	5.16
that's a pickup one away from orb now	11649.16	5.56
for a second or	11651.68	3.04
ultimate and if anything here they have	11654.96	4.359
that ultimate available for tuis if he	11657.76	3.88
wants to go for that TP in the back of	11659.32	3.801
the seaside to help and it's being	11661.64	3.759
pinged out by Sentinels Sentinels	11663.12	4.159
putting pings all the way through the	11665.40	3.641
back of Spawn here and it's right over	11667.28	5.841
the members of loud face your fear	11669.04	5.279
that's where they're trying to Ping	11673.12	3.239
where they want to initiate the	11674.32	5.0
Nightfall pain shells thrown by Z space	11676.36	4.481
has been gained Prowler pushing back	11679.32	3.361
towards the waterfall qck still still	11680.84	4.08
anchoring behind the pillar after that	11682.68	4.36
plant though show stopper available by Z	11684.92	4.0
beautiful flash do not allow for him to	11687.04	4.04
get Space off the showstopper does some	11688.92	5.08
damage on the qck down to 5 HP boombot	11691.08	4.48
about to come out through the smoke the	11694.00	3.16
paranoia countered by loud for the back	11695.56	3.719
of the spawn John CA gets a St by kill	11697.16	4.4
onto qck as s do has to move in with the	11699.28	3.801
rest but they're getting delayed by the	11701.56	3.64
utility of Sentinels on the PO plan a	11703.08	4.04
five versus three make that a four	11705.20	3.64
versus three Advantage for the Sentinels	11707.12	3.92
as well as L and the rest cannot move	11708.84	4.559
forward for loud finally it's tens that	11711.04	4.319
gets picked off two ninos storms onto	11713.40	4.241
the spike delayed available for zelus	11715.36	3.641
there is the Hop and now they're moving	11717.64	2.719
forward but finally they got rid of that	11719.00	4.479
udil it's at a halfway the swing out two	11720.36	6.521
with the second tap and Sassy gets that	11723.48	8.601
pick holy close call by both squads	11726.88	7.439
round seeing that play come to fruition	11732.08	4.239
for Sentinels I started thinking you	11734.32	4.761
guys planted for not Mound and you guys	11736.32	5.481
got you got guys outside the site loud	11739.08	5.399
also recognizing the plant position and	11741.80	5.36
for a defense that means they have some	11744.48	5.121
members in sight nobody plants down on	11747.16	5.72
that platform and all play Mound loud	11749.60	5.639
assessing the situation beautifully and	11752.88	6.04
dropping the members they needed holy	11755.24	6.721
moly not enough	11758.92	6.8
though it's tough for them it is tough	11761.96	5.96
for sure they're able to come back	11765.72	3.84
Sentinels even though they planted on	11767.92	5.6
that platform and get the get the round	11769.56	7.839
contact play Z is on fire Superstar now	11773.52	6.36
for Sentinels continues to lead the	11777.40	5.561
charge on all of these hits of the	11779.88	7.04
attack out although on the other side we	11782.96	5.84
did see the push from qck out towards	11786.92	5.359
the a main evening up the tally weapon	11788.80	5.32
upgraded at this corner looking to get	11792.28	4.401
upgraded as senos goes for the plant but	11794.12	3.88
there's that	11796.68	3.599
backstab John cuy with the plant gets	11798.00	3.88
the pit that's going to make it	11800.28	4.321
difficult now for allowed to	11801.88	2.72
retake second he sparman cannot be sorry	11804.64	9.4
all right very cool uh moving in now Les	11810.88	6.24
qck to do what they can here HP going to	11814.04	5.96
be going way down oh and short and close	11817.12	7.0
swings across alone oneon-one tap on the	11820.00	6.72
spike John cutie just staying outside of	11824.12	4.88
it gambling that he's not going to stick	11826.72	5.0
it just got spotted down to 11 Blaze	11829.00	5.279
wall now another tap John cuy forced to	11831.72	5.04
run in but now there's not enough time	11834.28	5.0
cus with another tap got it John cuy	11836.76	4.599
with the rest of the patience of	11839.28	5.641
Sentinels have they finished a half a	11841.36	7.801
102 what an incredible first half final	11844.92	7.6
match from Sentinels still on fire this	11849.16	5.319
late in the day this late through all	11852.52	4.719
these strategies John cuy and zelus	11854.48	5.281
still have a strap book to flip the	11857.24	5.801
pages through loud having having so much	11859.76	5.719
trouble figuring out what is the entry	11863.04	4.64
on this Sentinels composition how to get	11865.48	4.201
to the entry with all of their members	11867.68	4.44
Sentinels picks them apart one by one as	11869.68	4.519
they go for the rotations they get into	11872.12	5.44
position and here again just the time	11874.20	7.08
game being danced around Sentinels have	11877.56	6.919
been in so in control so much throughout	11881.28	6.12
this series and now the final map of 102	11884.48	5.441
10-2 with three rounds remaining for the	11887.40	4.281
Sentinels to be crowned the kickoff	11889.92	4.399
champion but SEL have a big cushion	11891.68	4.84
right now win this pistol will be	11894.32	4.801
everything and L has an uphill battle to	11896.52	4.64
fight a steep one2 as they take the	11899.12	4.239
attack pistol around underway and it	11901.16	4.36
comes down to this player right here for	11903.36	5.201
qck they don't have a composition that	11905.52	5.839
allows for them to do the explosion on	11908.56	3.96
the map control that they're trying to	11911.36	2.84
get the sight control that Z currently	11912.52	4.04
has for Sentinels so how will work the	11914.20	4.641
attack now with this type of	11916.56	4.56
comp here looking to make as little	11918.84	3.92
noise as possible looks like they might	11921.12	3.92
catch a paranoia here if they do gets	11922.76	3.4
into	11925.04	3.8
position right behind Rubble oh dear oh	11926.16	4.36
the Wall came down as well paranoid	11928.84	3.479
moving forward a one for one make that a	11930.52	3.6
two for one in favor of the SOS control	11932.32	3.761
towards the rubble as well hit by the	11934.12	5.239
Seas killed by tens again with a	11936.08	7.159
hatrick multi kills this whole series	11939.36	6.481
for the star player not only B zek but	11943.24	6.561
also T finding comfort in this role as	11945.84	8.76
Omen and dominating this kickoff so far	11949.80	8.0
two's with the backstab two for his name	11954.60	6.92
zelis is low on HP but it's a backstab	11957.80	6.32
for backstab John cutie is also there	11961.52	5.12
looking to move behind 30 seconds left	11964.12	5.359
signs to think otherwise looks like SOS	11966.64	6.24
wants to give up the spike at least for	11969.48	6.641
now they get to safety on this one red	11972.88	5.399
the play so far can't count out who	11976.12	4.52
though they hear yeah zelus hears that	11978.28	4.361
run John cue has to heaven	11980.64	3.48
getting into position so this will be	11982.64	4.04
money here for loud if loud do lose	11984.12	4.319
they're going to be buying next	11986.68	4.679
round expect the buy from loud Sentinels	11988.44	5.84
will too and it looks like we're going	11991.36	6.681
hard onto this one 11 to2 now do they go	11994.28	5.801
for it there's a stinger there's a few	11998.04	4.279
let's see the replay on the round	12000.08	4.84
looking at how they orchestrated this it	12002.32	5.561
was a lot on the fade whatever fade	12004.92	4.88
could see from link whatever sassy could	12007.88	4.96
look was then the hit from 10 on	12009.80	5.92
paranoia everybody then into it second	12012.84	5.08
went down first in that and they knew	12015.72	4.679
the play would still go through that as	12017.92	5.8
well the play that you saw from John cue	12020.40	6.04
the snake bite and also spraying in	12023.72	4.479
knowing that it was going to be a plant	12026.44	3.241
that's going to be unorthodox just	12028.20	3.881
trying to get it down for tuis and still	12029.68	5.2
manages to get that pick fragon IG	12032.08	5.48
calling perfectly for sels and steps up	12034.88	5.16
for these kills when he needs to the	12037.56	4.2
perfect piece to the puzzle right now	12040.04	4.92
for for Sentinels to close this series	12041.76	5.88
two rounds away as loud as you mentioned	12044.96	6.319
Riv is forced on a buy a main control	12047.64	5.4
Prowler just went through b for	12051.28	3.401
Sentinels so they have a bit of an idea	12053.04	4.359
of how long the timing will be and now	12054.68	4.519
the Trail Blazer alerts them a little	12057.40	4.96
bit more spike is b or sorry C here for	12059.20	6.681
loud fian does get the hit onto the jump	12062.36	5.201
spot but thankfully sedak is there with	12065.88	4.16
the heal Les is back and topped and now	12067.56	4.4
they're pting towards the seaside as	12070.04	3.56
mentioned because of that pressure and	12071.96	3.64
that control that SEL C has on that a	12073.60	4.639
site utility being broken on that cite	12075.60	4.28
as well snake bite to theay snake bite	12078.24	4.281
to push John cuy away as well first	12079.88	4.04
Conta now in the back of the pillar to	12082.52	3.24
that cided zelus with the stinger out of	12083.92	4.16
bullets flashed and pulled away and now	12085.76	4.84
it forces SEL to play the	12088.08	4.8
retake they're they got to stay in sight	12090.60	4.12
for this plant it's going to get real	12092.88	3.76
sketchy if they're all outside on Mound	12094.72	3.559
so you see them piling into water here	12096.64	4.4
they still have the flank from tuis but	12098.28	5.2
looks like T is ready ready for that one	12101.04	4.359
so far Taps the door or looking for the	12103.48	3.88
paranoia of the backstab missed the	12105.40	4.201
opportunity to close him down SE being	12107.36	3.92
pulled out after the shot to try to push	12109.60	4.08
them back once again sasi finally try to	12111.28	4.601
lead the charge but cenen strikes first	12113.68	4.12
it's back and forth but louder still	12115.88	4.64
holding the post plan celus is low on HP	12117.80	5.439
po by Kine with the classic it's up to	12120.52	7.32
only one more member T the time against	12123.24	6.921
them runs back out through the smoke	12127.84	4.92
tries to make it expensive in	12130.16	5.6
but loud holds down the post PL on their	12132.76	6.04
Force by Sentinels feels the sting on	12135.76	5.4
that round and almost necessary win	12138.80	5.12
game's over if loud dropped the Stinger	12141.16	5.96
by round but no they persevere they find	12143.92	5.96
a way to shred Sentinels and then they	12147.12	5.119
low plant in the sight knowing Stingers	12149.88	4.599
cannot win that fight from Mound and	12152.24	5.2
they cause chaos on Sentinels retake	12154.48	4.84
absolutely swarming the members of sen	12157.44	4.281
taking them down so a few free upgrades	12159.32	4.441
upgrades for loud here Sentinels back	12161.72	4.719
down on the Low by loud needs to carry	12163.76	5.32
these rounds for just about forever	12166.44	3.681
we'll see what	12169.08	3.68
happens a pressure will be given for now	12170.12	5.92
is a retake for Sen and Loud a lot of	12172.76	5.639
control on the map here really playing	12176.04	3.96
it slow to not make a mistake back and	12178.40	4.121
forth as they tempt any fight forever	12180.00	4.16
definitely seems like very long when	12182.52	2.919
you're trying to find Rune to Breathe	12184.16	3.159
Here trailing behind by eight rounds are	12185.44	3.92
allowed and already look how early these	12187.32	3.281
Trail lasers are coming from but it	12189.36	3.641
forces out the push the low that you	12190.60	4.679
have from SEL through the smoke Tu is	12193.00	3.72
ready for that drops them both with the	12195.28	3.601
Stinger allows for them to Pivot across	12196.72	3.559
but look at this reposition from John	12198.88	5.12
cue he decided to fall at behind his	12200.28	6.241
teammate's body the paranoia to come out	12204.00	5.319
at least one kill but out of that loud	12206.52	4.6
has full control of B full control of	12209.32	4.481
the map and now control of the spike	12211.12	5.4
planted Spike	12213.80	4.399
planted that's going to give him the	12216.52	5.36
contact not even need it well done here	12218.20	6.0
L converts two rounds in a row senal	12221.88	5.359
canot get the surprise play remember	12224.20	4.761
though if we're going back to the basics	12227.24	3.721
as well of this map a three side map	12228.96	3.84
you've mentioned here Riv very similar	12230.96	3.6
to Haven great ways to be able to	12232.80	4.0
default across the map great ways to	12234.56	4.4
actually pull rotations away and get a	12236.80	4.96
very strong attack side so SEL showed a	12238.96	5.6
very good 102 half on their attack but	12241.76	4.88
you definitely know that loud has what	12244.56	4.16
it takes and can do the same thing I	12246.64	3.92
mean they just pulled off a full Stinger	12248.72	5.24
221 fake strap right yeah anything is on	12250.56	5.919
the table right now back to guns on both	12253.96	5.439
sides 11 to four is no pressure for loud	12256.48	4.96
they're feeling the z0 on the scoreboard	12259.40	4.681
as they take shots and T however starts	12261.44	5.161
us off the haad information tends to s	12264.08	4.199
for attack while looking at the mean map	12266.60	3.599
and got the kill paranoid to push him	12268.28	3.641
away trying to fall back but there's a	12270.20	3.721
stin bite to not allow him from that	12271.92	3.68
Deep Cover but at least his teammates	12273.92	3.84
are there cover going out a little back	12275.60	4.24
and forth Sentinels will regain position	12277.76	3.92
of the rubble area after grabbing one so	12279.84	5.639
the 5v4 conversion now on send shoulders	12281.68	5.599
to get the W on this	12285.48	4.201
round this is where Sashi comes in or	12287.28	4.401
I'm sorry Sak comes into play the mid-	12289.68	4.96
round call what can happen Double Take	12291.68	5.28
on both sides of that mid area tu's just	12294.64	5.16
from mid and they're waiting on less	12296.96	4.84
maybe a little more info maybe a push	12299.80	4.88
but sen have not been giving that	12301.80	5.8
push heard the jumps the haunt here to	12304.68	6.32
he's forced to break it and give his	12307.60	5.08
position away	12311.00	3.279
they have this Rolling Thunder for Cen	12312.68	3.32
he made it all the way down towards the	12314.28	4.12
bottom and as the nms come out they	12316.00	4.72
could just wait for that timing all	12318.40	4.161
coming through gets cancel as twois is	12320.72	3.32
trying to find somebody towards that	12322.56	4.679
sight 30 seconds left but once again	12324.04	5.88
senel playing the	12327.24	5.0
retake waited out the Molly's going for	12329.92	4.399
the plant another plant that considers	12332.24	4.2
that loud has to stay inside with the	12334.32	4.201
Odin the se's got him to just sprayed	12336.44	3.92
through and now snake bights to delay	12338.52	3.16
and that's no rolling thunder going to	12340.36	2.641
push him back there's only 12 seconds	12341.68	3.32
left on the clock Forest into go for the	12343.00	3.72
stick but the sprays are not coming in	12345.00	3.68
this time around plant is down the push	12346.72	4.0
from tuis does not get the surprise kill	12348.68	4.44
there onto SEL TS on to rotate back from	12350.72	4.84
the spawn hot comes through sadak is all	12353.12	5.279
alone sedak gets two but gets dropped	12355.56	5.839
right after Sentinels with the theuse	12358.40	5.761
and Sentinel round a way of breathing	12361.40	4.361
this	12364.16	5.159
series oh my gosh that's the defuse they	12365.76	5.84
go for John cue or no zalis that's going	12369.32	4.481
to be an Alor towards the lock down	12371.60	4.759
anything that helps them secure these	12373.80	6.12
rounds from loud loud is able to get	12376.36	5.601
into the sights they do it as a death	12379.92	5.399
ball they squeeze in but the plants have	12381.96	5.92
been so tough for loud to get in a good	12385.32	4.841
position the low plants just on platform	12387.88	4.559
are not allowing them good defensive	12390.16	4.319
setups Sentinels comes in and just	12392.44	4.641
swarms from all angles in the end 12 to	12394.48	4.441
four now we are going to still have that	12397.08	4.319
Odin online for the side of Sentinels	12398.92	4.479
but loud are able to present now with	12401.40	4.84
full vandals just low armor on tuis in	12403.40	5.0
this Rolling Thunder they're going to	12406.24	3.601
fight for a rubble	12408.40	3.441
control it's going to be all about the	12409.84	4.16
map before the fights first they have to	12411.84	4.359
play this round in layers if loud wants	12414.00	3.52
to get through	12416.20	3.481
S do hear a little bit of damage being	12417.52	3.879
done here through the smoke but it's	12419.68	5.2
inflicted onto loud sedak and Les tagged	12421.40	5.161
a little bit remember this Rolling	12424.88	3.519
Thunder available not used on the	12426.56	3.08
seaside when they thought they had	12428.40	3.481
control this time though Z gets the open	12429.64	4.639
four kills away you thought you would	12431.88	3.96
have a rolling thunder open up the a	12434.28	4.2
site but instead it's reopening the door	12435.84	6.0
and sneaking Q	12438.48	3.361
around they have no idea what's behind	12442.32	3.761
them they don't know if somebody's in in	12444.52	2.719
baby door they don't know if somebody's	12446.08	3.319
now behind them at a main they have to	12447.24	4.601
move and loud can only go forward here	12449.40	3.96
that Rolling Thunder still ready could	12451.84	4.479
cover all of B they have qck just	12453.36	5.481
lurking waiting but nobody from	12456.32	4.04
Sentinels is stepping into the danger	12458.84	3.0
zone right now they're waiting for a	12460.36	3.441
plant knowledge loud just with their	12461.84	4.68
regular stop and go under the pressure	12463.80	4.76
out of elimination yet at the brink of	12466.52	4.959
elimination does these plays 2K trying	12468.56	4.48
to go for the hero one trying to see if	12471.48	4.161
he can catch one off guard got your at	12473.04	4.279
least to get the plant	12475.64	5.44
down 5v3 Rolling Thunder prepped and	12477.32	5.361
ready from the tree position they're	12481.08	2.8
going to actually try to rotate a little	12482.68	3.2
bit around tuis can have a big Flank In	12483.88	4.68
the End a few of these seconds being	12485.88	4.72
wasted getting to the spike but s still	12488.56	3.56
have a lot of time on the clock	12490.60	3.48
important to keep cow alive right now	12492.12	3.64
for the Rolling Thunder and he also has	12494.08	5.0
Aftershock holding the tree is the most	12495.76	5.4
important position but senel are looking	12499.08	3.319
to fight right back there's the	12501.16	3.119
Aftershock there's a swing out from 10	12502.40	3.8
but gets the nine and now the tap on	12504.28	3.641
that Spike two he's dropping one it's a	12506.20	3.961
two versus two right inside trying to	12507.92	4.24
stick it another one to fall it's all up	12510.16	4.48
to Z who does get the K trying to stick	12512.16	5.44
this bik he gets to the fuse with the	12514.64	6.24
red clutch and sendal are going to be	12517.60	6.12
your America's kickoff	12520.88	4.88
[Applause]	12523.72	5.09
Champions ice cold watch in his	12525.76	11.61
[Applause]	12528.81	8.56
