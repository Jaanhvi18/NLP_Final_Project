### Step 1: Define Project Scope and Categories
   - **Define what constitutes a "bug" or "issue"** by creating a list of keywords and phrases that users might use, like "crash," "lag," "glitch," "freeze," "broken," "unplayable," or "frame drops."
   - **Identify specific labels** for data categorization, including:
      - **Game Name**: The game being discussed.
      - **Platform**: The platform where the bug occurs (e.g., PC, PS5, Xbox).
      - **Issue Type**: The category of the issue, such as "performance," "visual bug," "gameplay bug," or "connectivity issue."
      - **Severity (optional)**: Low, medium, high, or critical, based on context or frequency.

### Step 2: Set Up Reddit Scraping
   - **Scrape relevant subreddits**: Use the Reddit API (or tools like `PRAW`) to pull posts and comments from specific game-related subreddits or broader gaming discussion subreddits (e.g., `r/gaming`, `r/pcgaming`, or game-specific subs).
   - **Filter by keywords**: Filter for posts containing bug-related keywords. You could limit your results by popular posts to capture the most engaged conversations.
   - **Save data**: Store scraped posts and comments in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV), with fields like post text, timestamp, username, and subreddit.

### Step 3: Apply NER and Keyword Matching
   - **Train or fine-tune an NER model**: If you're working with a specific game, you might need a custom NER model that recognizes unique in-game terms or features. Use an NER framework like `spaCy` or `transformers` to detect named entities.
   - **Identify relevant entities**:
      - **Game Names**: Detect the game title or acronym.
      - **Platform Names**: Detect platforms like "PC," "PlayStation," or "Xbox."
      - **Issue Terms**: Use keyword matching to identify common bug-related terms (e.g., "crash," "lag").
      - **Severity (optional)**: Detect sentiment around issues to infer severity based on phrases like "unplayable" (high severity) vs. "minor" (low severity).

### Step 4: Label the Data
   - **Create labeled fields** for each scraped entry based on NER and keyword extraction:
      - **Game Name**: Map detected game names to known titles, using synonyms or abbreviations if needed.
      - **Platform**: Map platforms to standard terms.
      - **Issue Type**: Classify each bug as "performance," "visual," "connectivity," etc., based on keywords or context.
      - **Severity (optional)**: Label based on detected keywords or sentiment scores, categorizing as "low," "medium," "high," or "critical."

### Step 5: Store and Organize Labeled Data
   - **Save labeled entries in a structured database** (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB) with fields for game, platform, issue type, and severity.
   - **Organize data for easy querying**, such as by game or by issue type, to enable developers to prioritize or analyze feedback quickly.

### Step 6: Visualize and Report Insights
   - **Summarize results** with data visualizations like bar charts or heatmaps, showing the frequency of issues by game, platform, or severity.
   - **Generate reports** that highlight the most common and severe bugs, helping developers focus on high-priority fixes.
   - **Export data for developer use**: Create CSV or JSON files summarizing the issues, providing a straightforward reference for developer teams.

### Example Labeled Data Output
Each entry might look like this after processing:

| Post ID | Game        | Platform | Issue Type      | Severity | Comment                                       |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 12345   | GameX       | PC       | Performance     | High     | "GameX crashes every time I try to load on PC" |
| 23456   | GameY       | Xbox     | Visual Bug      | Medium   | "Textures keep flickering on Xbox"           |
| 34567   | GameX       | PS5      | Connectivity    | Critical | "Can't connect to servers on PS5, unplayable" |
| 45678   | GameZ       | PC       | Gameplay Bug    | Low      | "Minor lag in cutscenes, not a big deal"      |

### Step 7: Analyze and Iterate
   - **Refine NER and keyword matching** based on test runs, iterating on the categories or keywords as necessary.
   - **Gather developer feedback** on the output to ensure the data is actionable and meets project goals.
