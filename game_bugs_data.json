        "text": "I introduced Roblox to my 7 and 9 yrs old kids w/o fully understanding what it is. Now that I've seen how the sausage is made and understand the motivations of its creators, I want them to avoid it like the plague. It's futile to articulate to them why it's bad and I clearly don't want them to resent me for taking away something they love, so I figured that the best strategy to go about it is to replace it with a novelty.\n\nRoblox is the amalgamation of everything that's wrong with the gaming industry and our brain rotting ethos, but I really don't want to get into it. IYKYK, and if you don't know, I'm sure many others have talked about it before.\n\nI'm looking for a game that's\n\n* Easy to get-started and play\n* Supports local co-play (no online play)\n* Offers novelity in every playthrough (this is key) \n* No micro transactions\n* Designed purely for enjoyment and not to make a quick buck by exploiting kids' attention and dopamine production \n* Isolated from our pop culture \n* Supported on Mac OS\n* Something that can be enjoyable in 1 hour playthrough (their daily screen time allotment)\n\nThey have Minecraft and used to like it, but stopped playing it altogether since Roblox was introduced.\n\nThanks for the help\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI didn't expect the post to explode like that :o.\n\nMost of the comments were kind-hearted and helpful. Thank you very much for that <3\n \nMy wife and I have decided to rip off the bandaid and not spend another day feeding this toxic addiction. The kids may be upset for a while, but they'll adjust and move on.\n\nTo those who have DM'd me about what's wrong with Roblox, here are some links other Redditors have posted:\n\n* PMG had two great videos on Roblox and some of its scummy practices: [Part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ) and [part two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&vl=en)\n* https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour\n* https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\n* https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/",

He cottoned to those things, but it was still Roblox, Roblox, Roblox.\n\nI did sit him down, and we talked about how playing Roblox makes him feel, how he feels when he's done, and how he feels when he doesn't play. We discussed how many of the feelings he talked about weren't good feelings. I then let him play Roblox on a tight time limit. After each \"please can I have more time\" meltdown, we discussed his feelings again.\n\nEventually, even though he agreed all along that it never made him feel great, he started realizing he enjoyed other things more as I made him constantly face his bad feelings about Roblox. Now, he plays a whole bunch of things in a much healthier way.\n\nIt's a good thing you recognized the issue. It's a tough fight but you can do it. Good luck.",

Game director Biloukat announced that the devs had been able to administer justice to the rogue Paulstar111. \"We observed a weird behavior for this player 'paulstar111,\" Biloukat said. \"We decided to ban him and we'll deeply investigate on his behavior on Monday!\"\n\n> Sadly, as soon as Paulstar111 was struck down, his villainy reemerged by another name. Within minutes of Biloukat's announcement, players were experiencing the same instant losses as they all found themselves matching with the latest unkillable demigod: a user named \"Schilleri11.\"\n\n> The sordid tale, however, had a baffling conclusion: Paulstar111 and Schilleri11 might have become unconquerable archvillains, but they hadn't known what the hell was happening either.

Couple dozen, at least.\n\n> \"We sincerely apologize to Schilleri11 and Paulstar111, as the problem was due to a matchmaking bug, and they were banned for security reasons,\" Biloukat said.\n\nWhy is this shit so funny to me?",

The game underperformed because on PC it wasn't on Steam and also because the performance expectations were out of whack. This was an expensive 2D Metroidvania in a fallow franchise not known for Metroidvanias and Ubisoft apparently expected it to do Metroid Dread numbers. \n\nWhy? How? Sure, breakout hits like Hollow Knight have sold many more copies but A) You can't guarantee a game is going to be a breakout hit, at least not unless it's part of a major franchise and very high budget (we all know GTA VI will do amazing numbers) and B) Hollow Knight was like a third of the price. \n\nSo Ubisoft's plan was \n\n1) Make Metroidvania spin off of a franchise with no recent hits\n\n2) Don't sell it on Steam\n\n3) ????\n\n3a) Have it be one of the highest selling games in the genre\n\n4) Profit.",

Metroidvanias are not mainstream games except for a few outliers like Hollow Knight that obtained a huge amount of attention online.\nThe game is great, but not a milestone in that sense. Doesn't help that it was more expensive than any current Indie metroidvania and has the name Ubisoft attached which will nowadays scare a lot of people away. It's sad to see because similar to Hifi Rush it sends the wrong message about an otherwise great quality product, but if publishers have huge sales expectations, these kinds of games are just bound to fail",

Insider Gaming learned that Ubisoft was was expecting the game to sell on par, or better, than some of biggest Metroidvania‚Äôs in the market. When that didn‚Äôt happen right away, a decision was made to move on from the project.\n\nI don't know where they got that 1 million number or if it's even true, but this has personally been my theory over the course of this entire debacle. People keep making snarky comments like \"remember this when people complain about how no one makes good single player games anymore.\"\n\nBut nah, that is probably not what happened here. Assuming this number is accurate Lost Crown is already one of the better selling metroidvanias of all time. It's a niche genre, the vast majority of releases in the genre do not see numbers like this.\n\nWhen Ubi greenlit this game the budget should have been made with the understanding that 1 million copies would be a huge success. Expecting to sell as well as the most popular games in the genre is just absolutely insane. This is just another case of Ubisoft management being completely out of touch with the industry.",

It‚Äôs obviously not close to high end PC level except Forbidden West that one looks almost similar to PC Ultra it‚Äôs stunning‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs a good step in the right direction \n\nPlaying games like Final Fantasy Rebirth with fidelity& performance more tolerable than the PS5 version is very nice. 4K native 120 for GT7 is phenomenal has me wishing it was like that at launch because it plays a lot better now. Just waiting on the patch. \n\nI‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre cool with your regular PS5 experience then not worth it but if you want to experience PlayStation games running closer to PC performance for a good price for what you get I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it.

        "text": "[My 'Portable' setup with Dock](https://preview.redd.it/syjyp99gevvd1.jpg?width=3786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa59d9e4a8f16f273b5aacac3c3210f7b46877)\n\n**TL;DR:** Bought a used original dock and converted it into a smaller, more portable version.\n\nRecently after getting my Switch, I went deep down the charging and docking rabbit hole. I thought I did my research, but wow, I was way off! There‚Äôs so much I didn‚Äôt know‚Äîdocks, accessories, charging standards, you name it. The chances of bricking the switch, plus, the number of fake \"original\" chargers on the market is insane. Honestly, I think even some authorized Nintendo sellers can‚Äôt tell the difference. If you‚Äôre interested, I will do a separate post comparing real vs. fake chargers. But this post is all about docks‚Äîyes, plural. I checked out a few 'recommended' third-party options before deciding to stick the original dock.\n\n# Genki Covert Dock:\n\nIt‚Äôs got mixed reviews. The concept is great, it‚Äôs super compact, and it‚Äôs the smallest out there, but there are some dealbreakers:\n\n* It might still brick your Switch.\n* Bricked on it's own\n* HDMI might stop working\n* The HDMI port is pointless if you're not using the display feature.\n* Lower power output (even their Covert Dock 2 only supports 45W).\n* Brightness issue\n* flickering\n* Unresponsive CS.\n* Pricey.\n\n**Amazon reviews:**  \n4.5/5 reviews, do checkout 1 to 3 stars and evaluating yourself.  \n[https://www.amazon.com/Global-Covert-Charger-Nintendo-Portable/dp/B0CRXZ6RM6?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Global-Covert-Charger-Nintendo-Portable/dp/B0CRXZ6RM6?th=1)\n\n[Display function stop working after few months](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/kxsxox/comment/gjzxnpq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n**General overall bad reviews was:**\n\n* HDMI working with just couple of uses\n* The dock dead within a year or after\n\nSource:  \n[Reddit: Genki Dock Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/13dh9jp/genki_covert_dock_for_nintendo_switch/)\n\n[Reddit: Bricked Switch Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/zsq2um/my_genki_covert_dock_bricked_my_switch/)\n\n[Convert dock brick report 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/govicm/i_think_my_genki_cover_dock_just_bricked_my_switch/)\n\n\n\n# Skull & Co JumpGate Pro:\n\nAnother one with mixed reviews. It has a cool, slim design and a detachable USB hub, which is clever. But here are the issues I found:\n\n* Sleep/wake problems on Sony TV. [Source: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoPH/comments/131sidu/comment/k9czeeg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* The spring push mechanism can get stuck.\n* Docking isn‚Äôt seamless; aligning the USB-C is tricky without the proper alignment support like the original dock.\n* Confirmed with their CS, It only works with the original Switch adapter, likely because they are not using a proper PD chip.\n* And honestly, their skull logo? Kinda ugly‚Äîdefinitely a reason I skipped their slim case.\n\n[S&C support team](https://preview.redd.it/tb0xwbuhcvvd1.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12aa9ae5a3536b9bcce6f79c7b84e5d0639bb6af)\n\n# Almost give up\n\nAfter going through all that, I said screw it and stick with my original dock. I didn‚Äôt want to risk bricking my Switch. After some research again turns out, there were custom shells for the original dock back in the day, but they‚Äôre hard to find now. Also, the idea that the Switch doesn‚Äôt use proper PD charging? Total myth.\n\n# Original Dock and AC Adapter:\n\nThe original dock and adapter support PD 2.0 and DCP with two power outputs:\n\n* 5V 1.5A\n* 15V 2.6A\n\nSource:  \nYT: [Original Dock Charging Test](https://youtu.be/UIZOiysipWs?t=84)\n\nAny decent **45W PD** charger should work for dock mode. However, some **Anker GaNPrime** chargers don‚Äôt work, but they‚Äôll still charge the Switch itself fine.\n\nSource:  \nReddit: [Anker Gan charger that works for dock mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xdgvr7/ganprime_chargers_dont_work_with_docked_nintendo/)  \nYT: [Live Anker Charger dock test](https://youtu.be/IGoT2lrlhk4?si=vazhpJtTUHRTfUkD)\n\n# Recommended Charging Cable\n\nWhile doing my research, I also found recommendations for charging cables that should work perfectly with the dock. Here‚Äôs what to look for:\n\n* **45W and above PD Type-C cable**\n* **Proper PD Type-C cable with a** [56k ohm resistor](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/ckaiiv/an_engineers_pov_on_the_3rd_party_dock_switch/) (recommended for safe charging)\n* **Any reputable branded PD cables** should work fine.\n\n# Custom Shells:\n\nI found two custom shell options:\n\n**Aolion DIY Case:**\n\n* The CS is pretty clueless.\n* The new shell has a built-in big LED, but it‚Äôs bulky and ugly.\n* Can't tell if which shell works with OLED dock.\n* The installation instructions are vague and miss key steps.\n* The shell looks flimsy.\n\n**ExtremeRate AiryDock DIY Kit:**\n\n* Super detailed install instructions on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gWbhvnb5Lyw?si=INb6HbeThICWxrKc).\n* Compatible with both the regular and OLED dock.\n* Better design and higher quality.\n* Well-packaged with spare parts.\n* Few colors and design choice.\n\n# Installation:\n\nDuring the disassembly, I accidentally broke the OLED dock's LED. The dock still works fine, but I just cannot let it go, so I had to source a replacement LED from China (because, of course, you can get *anything* from China).\n\n[OLED Dock PCB and LED Light](https://preview.redd.it/ik5oh3nybvvd1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0580ac6684b8dab9453026d918a329a6ae6603f3)\n\n[Replacement OLED Dock LED](https://preview.redd.it/3jskr98ydvvd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16fb92621608faec06cd686797d119207202e62a)\n\nI also added dust filters to the shell vents, which I think looks way better and keeps the dust out.\n\n[Added dust filter for dock shell](https://preview.redd.it/b51667f2evvd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4d319f534627511079826f03f84787404a9528d)\n\n[Added dust filter to bottom shell](https://preview.redd.it/c7lw3r94evvd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3ed636cae329e6e09df7258fc01323eb0dafb1f)\n\n# Size comparison\n\n[OG dock vs Custom shell](https://preview.redd.it/4js18lgqevvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=455a868c199b348c77512dfc56adcb20ef7c5de9)\n\n[The size different is massive!](https://preview.redd.it/2fj178yqevvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43491b43669566c98c5c4d54d4b37a7cf0d3e1dd)\n\n[It's just insane it big it original shell look.](https://preview.redd.it/85gl1v8revvd1.jpg?width=3949&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a047a6b5bfea2925352d8110932707211d0b6243)\n\nAfter the conversation, I added 3 rubber dust blockers for USB and Ethernet port.\n\n[USB ports, sry out of focus a little.](https://preview.redd.it/1gz51v98fvvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc63ee8ed43baab49739a45f5e697d8070340b66)\n\n[Ethernet port, sry again it looks out of focus.](https://preview.redd.it/mrvopb2dfvvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2656ace23bab368bf81b38ac4073100ecf9e9eda)\n\n# My ‚ÄòPortable‚Äô Setup:\n\n* Switch OLED\n* UGreen PD 60W Type-C cable with built-in 56kŒ© chip\n* UGreen 65W GaN 2C1A 3-port PD charger\n* SmallRig ultra-slim 4K HDMI cable\n* Original dock reshelled with the ExtremeRate AiryDock (I seriously hope they come up with a better name).\n\n[Switch OLED+HDMI\\/Type-C Cables+Reshell Dock+ 65W Charger](https://preview.redd.it/k0a8fy0zfvvd1.jpg?width=3786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=052c27b60c8bc2e21a4a9cc2d99445c50abc0b6f)\n\nOverall, this is my perfect setup, and it didn‚Äôt cost much (aside from that replacement LED I broke). I already had the UGreen charger and cable for years, so the real cost was just getting the used dock and the shell. The DIY process was pretty straightforward, and now I don‚Äôt have to worry about a third-party dock bricking my Switch.\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious, I can dive into the whole fake charger mess in another post. Thanks for reading, and happy gaming! Cheers!",

By the 25h mark, it should have ended\n\n\\- Extreme handholding where every time you enter a location, it shows a slow cutscene or your objective and the companion repeats the same thing which gets boring really fast\n\n\\- You don't even control Luigi except using some abilities. Also, his AI breaks some puzzle where , for example, you have to alternate between two tiles and Luigi doesn't respect the order and you have to be faster than him lol\n\n\\- The ship navigation is horrible. You have a map and simply click on the path to go. No sailing like Wind Waker or games like that\n\n\\- Performance issues mostly outside of combats\n\nI'm excited but these are valid points in my opinion",

        "text": "The supervisor I got to talk to said he was going to relay the info as feedback to Nintendo. I made sure to explain that stuff like overheating and sleep mode not working right was happening to others, but also had to clarify that I'm having similar issues with my Switch. He said this was the first he heard of it, and thought the issue probably isn't as widespread as it seemed. I clarified I felt it wasn't widespread but was enough of an issue as it affected multiple people. I should also note that my brother has a Switch, and he didn't have any issues like these. Granted, he primarily plays the Switch docked, but still.\n\nSo, yeah, here's hoping this can lead to a potential fix for the firmware. I also wanna mention that the supervisor in question is a pretty chill guy. Very understanding, considerate, and wanted to make sure to explore all options, including suggesting that I send the console in for repair *juuuuuuuust* in case the firmware isn't the main cause of it.\n\nI'm gonna be keeping an eye on my Switch for the time being, as well, and will turn it off completely after use just to be safe.\n\nUpdate: 19.0.1 has come, but it looks like, at least in my case, there are still issues. Battery still drains a bit quickly even in sleep mode, and I had a game paused during the credits with the Switch on the home menu. When I got back to it, it was further ahead in the credits. Not by a lot as it went slowly, but still an issue. Will put in a support request at [support.nintendo.com](http://support.nintendo.com) tomorrow. If you're still having issues, especially ones like this, I suggest you do the same. The more people tell them about this, the more likely a fix will happen.",

        "text": "I'm so tired of playing RPGs and text-heavy games where you have to squint to read the text in handheld or you can't play it from for far away on the TV because the text is tiny! I was surprised when even some Nintendo and Square Enix titles had this problem (you know you would think they would know best from their long production of text-heavy games and heavy experience with handheld and mobile titles). \n\nI've been playing Brothership and other than the shockingly great soundtrack (every track has stood out so far as stunning) and the vibrant coloring and animation, what I instantly noticed is it's so good to see large, easily readable text in this game. When I first saw the first dialogue encounters and tutorial text, I was so relieved. I couldn't believe that even in some Nintendo titles this generation they seemed to have forgotten their UI design from previous titles (maybe a part of Nintendo who had never worked in the handheld division).\n\nI hope going forward this is a sign that Nintendo and other developers won't make the same mistakes on the Switch successor. I'm tired of the myriad games that simply assume you're playing up close at your desk on a PC monitor and how they design UIs to fit the most information possible in the smallest space rather than to be readable. It's especially appreciated when text is large because complex Chinese characters are a lot harder to read when they're squished together.",

Riot got the perfect recipe for matchmaking 4-5 episodes ago and they completely messed it up. Matchmaking is the hardest its ever been and it's the most complicated its ever been with all ranks suffering heavily except for the top players that realistically, no matter the rank, would still end up in radiant.\n\n  \nIt's all about money. The more you're frustrated and you lose and you win, the more you'll be likely to want to get back into valorant. It's how Leagues worked and it's how Valorant works now as well.",

        "text": "I have no problem with him practicing Headhunter only in Unrated, but he does this in comp even when we were losing 4-9. His insistence to use Headhunter cost us so many rounds when he could've clutched with a simple spray instead of getting mowed down by enemy Vandal after missing all his shots. I told him to buy a Vandal and that he's practically griefing, but he got pissed and decided to idle in base as payback for the rest of the match‚Äîwhich of course we lost. He later told me that playing with me is no fun because I force him to play in a certain way while I believe such behavior in ranked is a bannable offense (sabotaging team) since it ruins the game for others who are trying their hardest to win. AITA?\n\nEdit: we are both 18. First-year college students and unfortunately dormmates. Unbelievable ikr? I was 90% sure he's the AH before posting but needed to make a point. Friend thinks his behavior is acceptable and I'm gonna show him how it isn't by sending him this post lmfao.",

If he is so insistent on using the headhunter, then make him your piggybank and make him buy you or your team weapons. If he is only using headhunter, then his buy is 2000 credits at most (1k armor, 1k abilities).\n\nPersonally though I would just stop playing with him in comp if he's gonna go afk, its very clear that its his way or nothing rather than trying to find a compromise. He will stay in that elo with that poor mental and I wish him luck in growing, not only as a player but as a person as his immaturity is blatant when you're just telling him the literal fundamentals of this game.",

        "text": "Is she a bad agent? No. Is she overpowered? No. Does fighting her require a skillset completely opposite to the games natural flow? Yes. Let draw a parallel with apex Here. In apex, movement players exist, same as in valorant. There are many more of them, and the movement is much much more advanced and high skill then here. I would know, i am a very skilled movement player myself in apex. The problem is, in apex if you want to kill a movement player, you simply need to be better at apex. Whereas in VALORANT, if you want to kill a movement player, you need to be better at APEX. It might be a bit confusing, but here me out. Killing a skilled neon requires a skillset that is the polar opposite of the one valorant forces you to cultivate. In apex, the aiming type is tracking. If you want to kill an apex movement player, all you need is better tracking, something the game naturally teaches you. In valorant, a more static aim style is used. You lock onto a target, and try to shoot one accurate bullet at the head. If you want to kill a valorant movement player, you need to TRACK her. I‚Äôm saying that because the average gold/dia player doesnt have godlike aim. Guaranteeing many vct players struggle sometimes. \n\nNow i know what you neon players are gonna say. ‚ÄúOh its fine if we have this playstyle because its very high skill so not many people can do it‚Äù. No. The average valorant player does not have enough bandwith to go learn a whole new method of aiming simply to deal with one agent. Not to mention the other way she completely deifies the games logic. She is 100% accurate while moving almost 4x the speed of a regular valorant enemy. Before neon, people could run and gun, but it was highly inefficient. The game simply wasn‚Äôt supposed to be played that way. Neon is Riot‚Äôs statement that ‚Äúwe seem to have lost the ability to reason with anything higher than the iq of a goldfish. We will now reject the games reality. We will now throw a nuclear bomb into the opera. We are not going to subvert valorants flow, we are going to throw it in a blender. Please tell me if you think I‚Äôm wrong.",

        "text": "I've been playin cs since I was 13-14. Played it as my only game from high school. throughout my military enlistment, and the last 8 months since I med-retired. My muscle memory for that game is beyond in my DNA now. I can probably hit one taps in cs with my eyes closed just by map knowledge, enemy routes, and timing. Cs also helped me develop a SERIOUS gambling addiction stemming from high school coin-flipping knife skins, to me as a grown ass man wagering literal tens of thousands of USD (more or less came out with nothing/negative as of today) all with virtual video game items. I didn't want to accept it was a real addiction until this summer when I realized I have not went out with friends or family in the 4 months I was free from the military, i would be on cs betting sites for 4-9 hours at a time, and eventually it came to where I would not want to even play counterstrike (my childhood safe place) unless I had skins to wager throughout. I accumulated probably around 15k+ in credit debt depositing into a VIDEO GAME BETTING SITE as a grown ass man. Coming out to my family about THIS kind of gambling addiction was NOT fun to do LMAO.\n\nIt completely switched my perception of what was once my go-to game for life. Now, about 3-4 weeks ago after a BIG BIG BIG fuckin loss I just sat staring at my blank monitor screen blankly for half an hour literally confused with what was real or not in my life. My CS inventory went to exactly 0 dollars for the first time in years, and that's where it still sits. I have not deposited since, I have not even thought about playin cs since. To put a cherry on top, cs2 has not been my favorite at ALL, and the cheater and matchmaking issues made it a chore for me to play as I only really solo queue since I don't have many friends. The community for me was beyond toxic and the shit you would hear casually every match was atrocious. I would have probably moved on from CS regardless because of this, but because of my problem stated before, I did it without thinking twice.\n\nI literally had NO idea that Valorant had a skin system that only allowed you to own skins YOU bought in game, and could NOT trade or sell after purchase. THIS is what I needed. I was always weary of Valorant because thats what you are fed as a cs player. But I have been playing for almost a week now, learning different agents, weapons and strats and just applying what I know from my CS life to this new game in a way that works. Im having a BLAST, it feels like how I felt learning CS for the first time, and the community is SO much more NORMAL as human beings. Every question I've had about an agent, weapon, or just what the fuck I'm supposed to do in the game have been answered by my teammates without a single instance of someone aggressively hazing me for not being Shroud at level 14. And NUMBER ONE... I can NOT gamble the skins I buy EVER even if I WANTED TO... Thats so beautiful to me. I bought the overdrive blade a few days ago as my first ever val skin, and while I was initially mad at myself for dropping 50 bucks on it; after the 3rd day playing with it and realizing I still own it, and haven't lost it betting in a bad case battle... it reminded me what I did it all for.\n\nIDK if this subreddit does stuff like this but shit AMA lmao.",

I have about 2k hours put into Apex for example and most of my skins and cosmetics came from loot packs, battle passes, etc. but I deleted my account with EA because the game was going downhill and I had one melee weapon for my main.

        "text": "First off, the Realm Walker itself is an awesome design and love the monster itself, but I just wish it felt more like an invasion of Sanctuary/the world, and cities were under siege by the massive armies summoned by these gigantic portal demons.There's some other big issues though:\n\n- Goblins inside the Realm Walker portal don't drop their normal bag of goodies. There's no variety or randomization with Treasure Goblin spawns or loot as well. That's just horrible and needs to be fixed asap.\n\n- The entire event offers no excitement or randomization because everything is exactly the same every run. At least Infernal Hordes offers a lot of enemy variety and The Council itself has different variations of bosses.\n\n- There's no variety to the realms we enter. It's always the same layouts and sane maps, with the same enemies. We should be entering all different realms of Hell and seeing different layouts to make each run interesting and fun.\n\n- Most of the loot chests drop hardly anything, and the rewards are bad and uninteresting.\n\n- There's no Unique item or Aspect to find for farming the event and defeating a special boss.\n\n- There's no final boss or uniques bosses to fight inside the Realms!? What a huge fail and anticlimactic fight. I was hoping to see Abaddon and other major demons return as bosses inside these Portals.\n\nBlizzard, you know you could do so much better with this event, and it should become a permanent part of the game AFTER you actually fix and improve these Realm Walker events.",

It's the same concern I have with most open world content: It's actually incredibly unfun to me when I'm on a fresh character and someone comes along and blows up the entire screen a million times over before I can even blink.\n2. Even if you're not instantly killing everything, it STILL moves and spawns enemies WAY too slow. It feels like the least threatening thing in the game.\n3. Immunity is boring unless there is some counter play. I always hated pure immunity moments in fights but the new raid taught me something very crucial, I have no problem with immunity mechanics IF you give me an objective to end that immunity. (Despite the raid having pretty bad rewards for the time you put in, I thoroughly enjoyed those fights.)\n4. Once you're inside the portal the density and rewards are nothing special outside of rep/opals and the portals inside of the instanced content are literally worthless. Why do those subzone portals exist? You go inside and it's usually like 1 elite pack that dies instantly.",

Also deep freeze feels bad compared.\n\nThen you have defensive skils and summons skills.  Either your build can synergize with summons and you pick mostly summons or you pick as many defensives as you can.\n\nThen the actual build is either the core or mastery skill you elected.  That's it.\n\nSo almost every build is [Core/Mastery] [defensive/conjurations] [ultimate].  Which feels reductive to say but it creates an extreme samey feel for a class that could easily be doing exciting things like creating combos when you frozen orb into a blizzard or other exciting synergies like that.\n\nThere's also the element gameplans.  Crackling energy?  A  meme but is like 1/5th of the nodes in the tree.  Also tying burning to critstrike damage node means you have one passive free generally,  because numbers.\n\nThere's a lot of problems, man.",

Since I don't play 24/7, it still gives me a lot of engaging time focusing on and enjoying my favourite character.\n\nI've taken part in several seasons with new classes, etc, but always ended up playing my favourites. It's fun to try out seasonal mechanics, and to play for the cosmetic rewards but not every time. Even in Eternal, endgame contains so many activities that within reasonable limits you can have a ton of fun even in the long term.",

S0 sorcerer almost ruined me for the game entirely.\n\nI played again for the first time this season with Spiritborn and I've already had several fairly obvious aspects and builds just appear to me without build guides. Every build should feel this way. I haven't finished the OG D4 story questline yet, but I've finished the DLC questline and I had fun. \n\nI'm starting to grind a bit of the mid-game stuff and if it sticks I'll probably aim for end-game builds, because there's a clear progression line for me, combat is rewarded, I won't die at the drop of a hat, and I can clear groups of mobs pretty safely and consistently.\n\nI'm approaching T1 farming without having to min-max my gear or farm utterly small drop rates to make it work, and that feels right to me. I can progress with paragon, glyphs, gear, aspects, etc. slowly, and I at least have a direction.\n\nIt's so much better now, and I wish it was this much better for every class, especially sorcerer, one of the first ones I tried.",

        "text": "Hello I started playing Diablo in 1999 when I got the playstation version, and so far, my favourite game in the series remained the first one, although I enjoyed 2 and 3 to some extent. One issue I have with 4 is it tries to hit a lot of the \"engagement culture\" I am not a fan off, and I feel even if you try to stay away from it. One thing I don't like is the fact it seems that any character build can be destroyed by an online nerf, something that seems to happen in many games, but can be  very frustrating in a game centered on itemization. I remmber I used to play a crusader using a bouncing shield, a hunter using explosive shots, for example, that got nerfed suddenly in Diablo 3, making them unplayable at the time I was using them. The fact there is no full offline mod means those updates can't be avoided.\n\nThe old games also had updates, but not at the same pace and at some point there was some stability reached where classes would remain more or less the same\n\nI also don't understand why while  the majority of people play in single player the marketting try to forcibly incentivize the multiplayer in its communication.\n\n[https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-players-vast-majority-playing-solo/https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-players-vast-majority-playing-solo/](https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-players-vast-majority-playing-solo/https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-players-vast-majority-playing-solo/)\n\nI have the feeling this will be perceived as a post from someone nostalgic  who doesn't \"get it\" but I wished there had been a way  for single player mode fans to filter out the online engagment culture and all that comes with it.  \n",

This isn't the first time this happened but after using Lacerate, I find myself clipping through terrain. \n\nAs if it wasn't enough that the wolf companions themselves occasionally get stuck underground after using the skill and annihilating my DPS, I wasn't ready to lose my progress while playing this game. I was carrying a defaced shrine part and lost it because I had to leave the dungeon to continue, and thus my dungeon was all for naught.\n\nThere is so much wrong with this class, and it's mostly bugs that ruin it from my point of view. I love the playstyle. Numbers could use a buff, but holy cow, this is unnerving to play.\n\nWe need a fix so badly.\n\nPS. Mad Wolf's Glee is also still bugged with that derpy wolf appearance.",

It just kills the whole computer.\n\nIf I just sit in game and do almost nothing like walk around or teleport from place to place or travel by mount - no problem. I can do that for hours. Soon as I start fighting mobs in any area on T4 difficulty, I've got 5 to 10 minutes before I'm done. Usually closer to 5.\n\nT3 almost never does this. T1 and T2 not at all, but I want to play in T4.\n\nI've checked all bios and drivers and updates at the latest version. (Nothing has changed since a month ago)\n\nUpdate: I am reiterating the update I made in the thread. Not long after I made this post, it never crashed again and still hasn't days later. I think one of the patches they put in that day fixed it, or it would still be occurring. But it's not.",

Things like GPU/CPU/RAM/etc would cause bluescreens and general system instability and not just immediately power off the system.\n\nIf your PC just shuts off, no warning, no BSOD, nothing. It's a power delivery issue. No two ways around it. The fact that it only occurs when more demanding things happen(i.e your system needs more power to keep up due to more enemies and spell effects on screen of higher tiers) solidifies this case.\n\nSo it could be a few things:\n\n* The power strip/UPS/whatever you have your PC plugged into is going bad or is bad. I've had power strips that just couldn't deliver the needed power anymore and plugging directly to the wall would be fine. Worth a shot.\n\n* Your PC's PSU is marginal or going bad, it isn't supplying enough power to keep everything on under high load due to some sort of fault, so it trips current overprotection(or just fails in another way to the same effect) and shuts off to protect itself and all components.\n\n* Likewise, the above can happen if your PSU is too small for your current components and attempting to draw more power than it can provide.\n\nFrankly, you're lucky your PSU is doing it's job and protecting itself and the rest of your PC by just cutting the power. When PSU's die they often go violently and take more than just themselves in the crossfire. If using a different power strip or UPS(assuming you are using one) or a different wall outlet doesn't work, replace your PC's power supply.",

I logged back in an hour ago to continue playing the Vessel Of Hatred Campaign, and all of i sudden i felt some FPS drops. I checked my settings for like the 10th time today, and found out my upscaling is set to \"none\". Then i found that the DLSS upscaling option is completely missing. There is one page on the blizzard tech support website that states the same issue, and it was created 2 hours ago. I thought i'd post here to check if the other 6 guys and i are not the only ones facing this issue.\n\nPS: My GPU is running perfectly fine, and ive checked with other games that allow the DLSS Option and it was there and working fine. My drivers are updated aswell.",

        "text": "So I came back from eating my dinner and noticed that Diablo 1 of all games on bnet had an update for both it and Hellfire. I don't remember what version it changed base Diablo 1 to, but it added an \"a\" at the end of Hellfire's patch version, which makes me think they plan on continuing to update the games. And if you log onto old school battlenet there are, at least at the time I jumped on, what looked like a couple blizzard employees or bots hanging out in one of the channels. Anyone got any ideas what the patch did, or theories as to why they'd update Diablo 1 of all games all of a sudden?\n\nThink maybe they're gonna give Diablo 1 the D2R treatment?\n\nEdit:  \nI mentioned this in a reply to a comment but most people seemed to have overlooked it, so I am editing my OP with said reply. This is for anyone who has tried launching Diablo 1 through battlenet but the game just crashes out with an error. Note that this is what worked for me, your mileage may vary, and it's a weird work-around for sure but it does seem to do the trick, at least for me. \n\nI found what got the game to run via the Bnet launcher for me was to go to the games directory, which on bnet you can hit the cogwheel next to the play button and choose \"Show In Explorer\" to automatically bring you to the games directory. From there I just launched the game through the Diablo.exe and after doing that I was able to start launching it through the bnet launcher. Kind of a weird bug but that's what solved it for me.",

The hot fixes improved this, but I ultimately lost 4 HC chars before deciding to use my brain and stop. I assumed the last big patch would've solved this, but it did not. I got two fenris crashes within minutes of booting the new patch. I tried most things that did not work. However, this seemed to work for me. \n\nhttps://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/diablo-iv-has-run-out-of-memory/130683/118\n\nJust sharing in cases anyone was like me. So far I've played about 2-3 hours without a crash, which is miraculous. \n\nHoping it helps others and continues to help me. \n\n\nEdit: the crashes have returned. At a loss. Rolling back the driver didn't work either. Had a few blissful hours. HC guy still alive for now. Will have to wait for Nvidia or blizzard to fix it. \n\nEdit 2: still ongoing. Maddening. Very, very frequent. ",

You think this item is good because you do not understand how stats in this game affect your actual damage output.\n\nMy character has around 10,000% additive damage. It all gets lumped together in one bucket. It is not a multiplier of any kind. Adding another 350% on top of 10,000% is a drop in the bucket that won't make a meaningful impact on my actual damage output. While technically yes, it is an increase, because it's a not a separate multiplicative increase, it won't actually scale my damage in a meaningful way. \n\nDo a Google search for \"damage buckets Diablo 4 explained\" and you'll understand my point after doing some reading.\n\nLet's put it this way. If I have 10,000% additive damage, and I gain 350% more, how much do I now have? 10,350%. How much more damage is 10,350 than 10,000? To find out, divide 10,350 by 10,000.\n\n10,350 √∑ 10,000 = 1.035\n\nSo I gain 3.5% overall more damage. So the 350% you think is impressive is actually just +3.5% total damage increase.",

                "text": "Don't listen to others saying to switch builds. Zealot is a strong build and can easily get through hell.\n\nHere's some fixes you can work towards -\n\n1. Your weapon is good vs bosses, it's bad vs everything else. The crushing blow is great because it does % damage to bosses, but it has **low damage.** Low damage = low leech = dying. Black is an excellent runeword but your base is exceptional not elite Putting it in a tyrant club ups your damage from 3400 to 5200. A scourge ups from 5500 Significant upgrade. Finding these will be tough though. Just to illustrate how bad black is vs monsters - an unupgraded [headstriker ](https://diablo2.io/uniques/headstriker-t805.html)will boost your damage to 8k or 12k upgraded. If you have access to something like [Heaven's light](https://diablo2.io/uniques/heaven-s-light-t808.html), then your damage rockets up to 10k, or 12k if you socket it with 2 eth runes. [Butcher's pupil ](https://diablo2.io/uniques/butcher-s-pupil-t717.html)is another unique that starts at 6.5k damage for you, or 11k upped with a shael. Pretty much everything is an upgrade for you in an elite base - crescent moon. unbending will, OATH obviously,\n2. Your leech is low. 4% lifesteel is low. You should have one more source of leech. Combine this with more base damage and you should be good to go.\n3. Your jewelry is bad. Your priority should be leech (life most importantly), attack rating, resists, life\n4. You have no source of cannot be frozen. I imagine you are painfully aware of this. It is worth dropping your helmet and making [Wisdom](https://diablo2.io/runewords/wisdom-t785743.html). This solves your mana issues, gives you a load of Attack rating, and of course cannot be frozen. I think nats technically beats this out because of the massive dex and resists, but you NEED cbf imo. If you can find another source of CBF, then you should be making [BULWARK ](https://diablo2.io/runewords/bulwark-t1282113.html)if you're having survivability issues. It's cheap, has loads of leech, and will make you way tankier.\n5. I imagine your merc is dead all the time. Make bulwark for him.\n6. Remember that treachery procs Fade (lvl 15) which gives 60% all resist. The problem is that it only has a 1/20 chance of triggering, so while you can plan for less resists (you have far too much now and you should be prioritizing resists less with your gear) you still have some moments where things can be sketchy on game creation until it procs. After it procs it lasts for 5 minutes so you will reliably proc it again before it runs out when playing through the game.",

You will need to skip some areas and monster packs.  It is certainly doable but will require patience.  Resists and crushing blow are good\n\nIf you want to switch to a spellcaster, hammerdin will beat hell pretty easily with a few item tweaks.  Some complain about aiming hammers but I think the hammerdin is really satisfying to use.  Hammers hit hard, you run fast, you heal fully after killing a group of monsters, you get a sick looking shield.",
