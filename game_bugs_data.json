Game director Biloukat announced that the devs had been able to administer justice to the rogue Paulstar111. \"We observed a weird behavior for this player 'paulstar111,\" Biloukat said. \"We decided to ban him and we'll deeply investigate on his behavior on Monday!\"\n\n> Sadly, as soon as Paulstar111 was struck down, his villainy reemerged by another name. Within minutes of Biloukat's announcement, players were experiencing the same instant losses as they all found themselves matching with the latest unkillable demigod: a user named \"Schilleri11.\"\n\n> The sordid tale, however, had a baffling conclusion: Paulstar111 and Schilleri11 might have become unconquerable archvillains, but they hadn't known what the hell was happening either. Through no fault of their own, a networking error earned them the hatred of‚Äîwell, however many people are playing Champions Tactics.

Sure, breakout hits like Hollow Knight have sold many more copies but A) You can't guarantee a game is going to be a breakout hit, at least not unless it's part of a major franchise and very high budget (we all know GTA VI will do amazing numbers) and B) Hollow Knight was like a third of the price. \n\nSo Ubisoft's plan was \n\n1) Make Metroidvania spin off of a franchise with no recent hits\n\n2) Don't sell it on Steam\n\n3) ????\n\n3a) Have it be one of the highest selling games in the genre\n\n4) Profit.",

Doesn't help that it was more expensive than any current Indie metroidvania and has the name Ubisoft attached which will nowadays scare a lot of people away. It's sad to see because similar to Hifi Rush it sends the wrong message about an otherwise great quality product, but if publishers have huge sales expectations, these kinds of games are just bound to fail",

Insider Gaming learned that Ubisoft was was expecting the game to sell on par, or better, than some of biggest Metroidvania‚Äôs in the market. When that didn‚Äôt happen right away, a decision was made to move on from the project.\n\nI don't know where they got that 1 million number or if it's even true, but this has personally been my theory over the course of this entire debacle. People keep making snarky comments like \"remember this when people complain about how no one makes good single player games anymore.\"\n\nBut nah, that is probably not what happened here. Assuming this number is accurate Lost Crown is already one of the better selling metroidvanias of all time. It's a niche genre, the vast majority of releases in the genre do not see numbers like this.\n\nWhen Ubi greenlit this game the budget should have been made with the understanding that 1 million copies would be a huge success. Expecting to sell as well as the most popular games in the genre is just absolutely insane. This is just another case of Ubisoft management being completely out of touch with the industry.",

It‚Äôs obviously not close to high end PC level except Forbidden West that one looks almost similar to PC Ultra it‚Äôs stunning‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs a good step in the right direction \n\nPlaying games like Final Fantasy Rebirth with fidelity& performance more tolerable than the PS5 version is very nice. 4K native 120 for GT7 is phenomenal has me wishing it was like that at launch because it plays a lot better now. Just waiting on the patch. \n\nI‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre cool with your regular PS5 experience then not worth it but if you want to experience PlayStation games running closer to PC performance for a good price for what you get I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it.

        "text": "[My 'Portable' setup with Dock](https://preview.redd.it/syjyp99gevvd1.jpg?width=3786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa59d9e4a8f16f273b5aacac3c3210f7b46877)\n\n**TL;DR:** Bought a used original dock and converted it into a smaller, more portable version.\n\nRecently after getting my Switch, I went deep down the charging and docking rabbit hole. I thought I did my research, but wow, I was way off! There‚Äôs so much I didn‚Äôt know‚Äîdocks, accessories, charging standards, you name it. The chances of bricking the switch, plus, the number of fake \"original\" chargers on the market is insane. Honestly, I think even some authorized Nintendo sellers can‚Äôt tell the difference. If you‚Äôre interested, I will do a separate post comparing real vs. fake chargers. But this post is all about docks‚Äîyes, plural. I checked out a few 'recommended' third-party options before deciding to stick the original dock.\n\n# Genki Covert Dock:\n\nIt‚Äôs got mixed reviews. The concept is great, it‚Äôs super compact, and it‚Äôs the smallest out there, but there are some dealbreakers:\n\n* It might still brick your Switch.\n* Bricked on it's own\n* HDMI might stop working\n* The HDMI port is pointless if you're not using the display feature.\n* Lower power output (even their Covert Dock 2 only supports 45W).\n* Brightness issue\n* flickering\n* Unresponsive CS.\n* Pricey.\n\n**Amazon reviews:**  \n4.5/5 reviews, do checkout 1 to 3 stars and evaluating yourself.  \n[https://www.amazon.com/Global-Covert-Charger-Nintendo-Portable/dp/B0CRXZ6RM6?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Global-Covert-Charger-Nintendo-Portable/dp/B0CRXZ6RM6?th=1)\n\n[Display function stop working after few months](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/kxsxox/comment/gjzxnpq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n**General overall bad reviews was:**\n\n* HDMI working with just couple of uses\n* The dock dead within a year or after\n\nSource:  \n[Reddit: Genki Dock Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/13dh9jp/genki_covert_dock_for_nintendo_switch/)\n\n[Reddit: Bricked Switch Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/zsq2um/my_genki_covert_dock_bricked_my_switch/)\n\n[Convert dock brick report 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/govicm/i_think_my_genki_cover_dock_just_bricked_my_switch/)\n\n\n\n# Skull & Co JumpGate Pro:\n\nAnother one with mixed reviews. It has a cool, slim design and a detachable USB hub, which is clever. But here are the issues I found:\n\n* Sleep/wake problems on Sony TV. [Source: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoPH/comments/131sidu/comment/k9czeeg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* The spring push mechanism can get stuck.\n* Docking isn‚Äôt seamless; aligning the USB-C is tricky without the proper alignment support like the original dock.\n* Confirmed with their CS, It only works with the original Switch adapter, likely because they are not using a proper PD chip.\n* And honestly, their skull logo? Kinda ugly‚Äîdefinitely a reason I skipped their slim case.\n\n[S&C support team](https://preview.redd.it/tb0xwbuhcvvd1.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12aa9ae5a3536b9bcce6f79c7b84e5d0639bb6af)\n\n# Almost give up\n\nAfter going through all that, I said screw it and stick with my original dock. I didn‚Äôt want to risk bricking my Switch. After some research again turns out, there were custom shells for the original dock back in the day, but they‚Äôre hard to find now. Also, the idea that the Switch doesn‚Äôt use proper PD charging? Total myth.\n\n# Original Dock and AC Adapter:\n\nThe original dock and adapter support PD 2.0 and DCP with two power outputs:\n\n* 5V 1.5A\n* 15V 2.6A\n\nSource:  \nYT: [Original Dock Charging Test](https://youtu.be/UIZOiysipWs?t=84)\n\nAny decent **45W PD** charger should work for dock mode. However, some **Anker GaNPrime** chargers don‚Äôt work, but they‚Äôll still charge the Switch itself fine.\n\nSource:  \nReddit: [Anker Gan charger that works for dock mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xdgvr7/ganprime_chargers_dont_work_with_docked_nintendo/)  \nYT: [Live Anker Charger dock test](https://youtu.be/IGoT2lrlhk4?si=vazhpJtTUHRTfUkD)\n\n# Recommended Charging Cable\n\nWhile doing my research, I also found recommendations for charging cables that should work perfectly with the dock. Here‚Äôs what to look for:\n\n* **45W and above PD Type-C cable**\n* **Proper PD Type-C cable with a** [56k ohm resistor](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/ckaiiv/an_engineers_pov_on_the_3rd_party_dock_switch/) (recommended for safe charging)\n* **Any reputable branded PD cables** should work fine.\n\n# Custom Shells:\n\nI found two custom shell options:\n\n**Aolion DIY Case:**\n\n* The CS is pretty clueless.\n* The new shell has a built-in big LED, but it‚Äôs bulky and ugly.\n* Can't tell if which shell works with OLED dock.\n* The installation instructions are vague and miss key steps.\n* The shell looks flimsy.\n\n**ExtremeRate AiryDock DIY Kit:**\n\n* Super detailed install instructions on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gWbhvnb5Lyw?si=INb6HbeThICWxrKc).\n* Compatible with both the regular and OLED dock.\n* Better design and higher quality.\n* Well-packaged with spare parts.\n* Few colors and design choice.\n\n# Installation:\n\nDuring the disassembly, I accidentally broke the OLED dock's LED. The dock still works fine, but I just cannot let it go, so I had to source a replacement LED from China (because, of course, you can get *anything* from China).\n\n[OLED Dock PCB and LED Light](https://preview.redd.it/ik5oh3nybvvd1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0580ac6684b8dab9453026d918a329a6ae6603f3)\n\n[Replacement OLED Dock LED](https://preview.redd.it/3jskr98ydvvd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16fb92621608faec06cd686797d119207202e62a)\n\nI also added dust filters to the shell vents, which I think looks way better and keeps the dust out.\n\n[Added dust filter for dock shell](https://preview.redd.it/b51667f2evvd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4d319f534627511079826f03f84787404a9528d)\n\n[Added dust filter to bottom shell](https://preview.redd.it/c7lw3r94evvd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3ed636cae329e6e09df7258fc01323eb0dafb1f)\n\n# Size comparison\n\n[OG dock vs Custom shell](https://preview.redd.it/4js18lgqevvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=455a868c199b348c77512dfc56adcb20ef7c5de9)\n\n[The size different is massive!](https://preview.redd.it/2fj178yqevvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43491b43669566c98c5c4d54d4b37a7cf0d3e1dd)\n\n[It's just insane it big it original shell look.](https://preview.redd.it/85gl1v8revvd1.jpg?width=3949&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a047a6b5bfea2925352d8110932707211d0b6243)\n\nAfter the conversation, I added 3 rubber dust blockers for USB and Ethernet port.\n\n[USB ports, sry out of focus a little.](https://preview.redd.it/1gz51v98fvvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc63ee8ed43baab49739a45f5e697d8070340b66)\n\n[Ethernet port, sry again it looks out of focus.](https://preview.redd.it/mrvopb2dfvvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2656ace23bab368bf81b38ac4073100ecf9e9eda)\n\n# My ‚ÄòPortable‚Äô Setup:\n\n* Switch OLED\n* UGreen PD 60W Type-C cable with built-in 56kŒ© chip\n* UGreen 65W GaN 2C1A 3-port PD charger\n* SmallRig ultra-slim 4K HDMI cable\n* Original dock reshelled with the ExtremeRate AiryDock (I seriously hope they come up with a better name).\n\n[Switch OLED+HDMI\\/Type-C Cables+Reshell Dock+ 65W Charger](https://preview.redd.it/k0a8fy0zfvvd1.jpg?width=3786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=052c27b60c8bc2e21a4a9cc2d99445c50abc0b6f)\n\nOverall, this is my perfect setup, and it didn‚Äôt cost much (aside from that replacement LED I broke). I already had the UGreen charger and cable for years, so the real cost was just getting the used dock and the shell. The DIY process was pretty straightforward, and now I don‚Äôt have to worry about a third-party dock bricking my Switch.\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious, I can dive into the whole fake charger mess in another post. Thanks for reading, and happy gaming! Cheers!",

By the 25h mark, it should have ended\n\n\\- Extreme handholding where every time you enter a location, it shows a slow cutscene or your objective and the companion repeats the same thing which gets boring really fast\n\n\\- You don't even control Luigi except using some abilities. Also, his AI breaks some puzzle where , for example, you have to alternate between two tiles and Luigi doesn't respect the order and you have to be faster than him lol\n\n\\- The ship navigation is horrible. You have a map and simply click on the path to go. No sailing like Wind Waker or games like that\n\n\\- Performance issues mostly outside of combats\n\nI'm excited but these are valid points in my opinion",

        "text": "The supervisor I got to talk to said he was going to relay the info as feedback to Nintendo. I made sure to explain that stuff like overheating and sleep mode not working right was happening to others, but also had to clarify that I'm having similar issues with my Switch. He said this was the first he heard of it, and thought the issue probably isn't as widespread as it seemed. I clarified I felt it wasn't widespread but was enough of an issue as it affected multiple people. I should also note that my brother has a Switch, and he didn't have any issues like these. Granted, he primarily plays the Switch docked, but still.\n\nSo, yeah, here's hoping this can lead to a potential fix for the firmware. I also wanna mention that the supervisor in question is a pretty chill guy. Very understanding, considerate, and wanted to make sure to explore all options, including suggesting that I send the console in for repair *juuuuuuuust* in case the firmware isn't the main cause of it.\n\nI'm gonna be keeping an eye on my Switch for the time being, as well, and will turn it off completely after use just to be safe.\n\nUpdate: 19.0.1 has come, but it looks like, at least in my case, there are still issues. Battery still drains a bit quickly even in sleep mode, and I had a game paused during the credits with the Switch on the home menu. When I got back to it, it was further ahead in the credits. Not by a lot as it went slowly, but still an issue. Will put in a support request at [support.nintendo.com](http://support.nintendo.com) tomorrow. If you're still having issues, especially ones like this, I suggest you do the same. The more people tell them about this, the more likely a fix will happen.",

        "text": "I'm so tired of playing RPGs and text-heavy games where you have to squint to read the text in handheld or you can't play it from for far away on the TV because the text is tiny! I was surprised when even some Nintendo and Square Enix titles had this problem (you know you would think they would know best from their long production of text-heavy games and heavy experience with handheld and mobile titles). \n\nI've been playing Brothership and other than the shockingly great soundtrack (every track has stood out so far as stunning) and the vibrant coloring and animation, what I instantly noticed is it's so good to see large, easily readable text in this game. When I first saw the first dialogue encounters and tutorial text, I was so relieved. I couldn't believe that even in some Nintendo titles this generation they seemed to have forgotten their UI design from previous titles (maybe a part of Nintendo who had never worked in the handheld division).\n\nI hope going forward this is a sign that Nintendo and other developers won't make the same mistakes on the Switch successor. I'm tired of the myriad games that simply assume you're playing up close at your desk on a PC monitor and how they design UIs to fit the most information possible in the smallest space rather than to be readable. It's especially appreciated when text is large because complex Chinese characters are a lot harder to read when they're squished together.",
