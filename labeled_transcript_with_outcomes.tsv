include the playoffs one now they're up	0.0	5.52	1
to 18 games absolutely crazy stuff so	1.56	5.719	1
they definitely a lot of homework for	5.52	3.999	1
loud to read but are ready for the game	7.28	4.081	1
for sure and send cities here behind	9.52	3.921	1
them the loud fans already get into that	11.36	4.919	1
Volume 11 as well as we start off here	13.44	5.52	1
on Sunset for the grand finals a lot of	16.28	5.0	1
tiles work from sen just to make sure	18.96	5.399	1
that mid area is controlled from loud it	21.28	4.84	1
feels like loud's being real passive	24.36	3.361	1
here they're ready to go for a first	26.12	3.961	1
round retake with whatever sensal hits	27.72	4.16	0
only on that midt there was a lot of	30.08	2.8	0
pressure on both sides from the	31.88	2.48	0
initiator getting information on the	32.88	3.48	1
extremities and now as you mentioned	34.36	3.84	1
playing the retake stop for out there's	36.36	3.84	1
still a first Contact from tuis throwing	38.2	4.8	1
up paranoia keeping clis at B from s	40.2	4.359	1
finally a first Contact but the heavy	43.0	4.079	1
damage goes on to John cuy sels get	44.56	3.921	1
still want to move forward in this	47.08	5.0	1
pistol and Loud decide to pull	48.48	3.599	1
back smoke happening on left side lane	52.36	4.2	1
clearing out towards the left side	55.2	4.0	1
actually probably get 2 CK right now as	56.56	4.48	0
a one way smoke comes up Sentinels tries	59.2	3.721	0
to execute in it actually does hit Q G	61.04	3.241	1
for at the back of the sight there's the	62.92	3.64	1
first Blood dropped by the sels a second	64.28	5.6	1
as well by Z and cloud is falling down	66.56	5.36	1
on this pistol with the spike down on	69.88	5.2	1
the east side for S fantastic job at not	71.92	5.48	1
allowing loud to get into a positioning	75.08	4.719	1
as we kind of saw on Ascent they can't	77.4	4.52	0
get this utility these flashes in order	79.8	4.921	1
that sad Dart in place and Sentinels	81.92	4.76	1
bite back before the retake even really	84.72	4.28	1
happens there Les now a few final kills	86.68	4.119	1
on the exit to hopefully collect some	89.0	4.079	0
money for the squad in a a different buy	90.8	4.041	0
next round but we'll see a lot of teams	93.08	4.161	0
have been full classic saving out on	94.84	4.84	0
that second round favoring a bit of	97.24	4.64	0
utility we'll see if loud decides to do	99.68	4.6	0
that Sentinels pick up the first round	101.88	4.199	0
and they start off with a little bit of	104.28	3.68	0
a cross the map they were looking mid	106.08	3.64	0
first then they were moving over to the	107.96	4.4	1
side of a but they took it slow again	109.72	4.601	1
something different we're seeing with	112.36	3.92	1
John cuy and Sentinels that they'll work	114.32	4.04	1
the map a bit before actually making	116.28	4.36	1
that commitment	118.36	4.399	0
with loud seems they were heavily	120.64	3.64	0
pressured that retake style they wanted	122.76	3.72	0
to get SEL wanted to continue to fight	124.28	3.92	1
forward after that Spike plan now	126.48	4.0	1
putting themselves for alloud on defense	128.2	4.16	1
on a stack towards the BS side setting	130.48	5.081	1
up for potentially a trap play but maybe	132.36	4.68	1
getting information first you already	135.56	3.2	1
see out in the open sadak is just	137.04	6.12	1
waiting for a contact for a push anybody	138.76	6.88	1
towards the B main sign you even see	143.16	4.28	1
kenzine trying to play a little tricky	145.64	4.56	1
hide spot in the market major he is just	147.44	4.28	1
waiting for that wall to go up and catch	150.2	3.92	1
somebody off guard again the slow play	151.72	3.92	1
from Sentinels they're they're pretty	154.12	4.199	0
much repeating first round strap right	155.64	4.8	0
we see that Zin and John cuy are working	158.32	4.761	0
tiles this time they proceed into mid	160.44	3.96	0
but that door is going to be shut on	163.08	3.64	0
them right quick looks like they could	164.4	3.4	1
go all the way through here this is	166.72	2.599	1
going to be trouble for loud to regain	167.8	3.519	1
any positioning loud's been good at it	169.32	4.0	1
so far continuing the good reads always	171.32	3.321	1
being active around the map on their	173.32	3.361	1
defensive side back towards the spawn	174.64	4.08	1
they here Sentinel stopping towards the	176.68	3.88	1
aite again they there is some sort of	178.72	3.519	1
Hope Here If tuis There He Go gets that	180.56	4.2	1
contact onto 10 slowing the pace of the	182.24	4.761	1
attack instantly traded out by John cuy	184.76	3.96	1
though as the plant goes down for beat	187.0	3.519	1
for a	188.72	4.4	0
main triple push forward but the cross	190.52	4.64	1
is just too good for Sentinels they do a	193.12	4.32	1
little bit of damage here for L and you	195.16	3.64	0
know what I'm not going to Discount this	197.44	4.56	0
player qck finally pushed forward by Z	198.8	5.601	0
and SEL get the second round all right	202.0	5.319	0
two patient rounds from Sentinels they	204.4	4.759	0
pretty much walk themselves into a	207.32	3.64	0
situation where they're fighting loud	209.16	4.08	1
the first one ended up at a on pistol	210.96	3.84	1
that second one they were able to find	213.24	3.441	1
their fight as they push Behind Enemy	214.8	4.0	1
Lines in mid which also works out for	216.68	4.4	1
Sen because now they have a bit of map	218.8	4.601	1
info of how loud will play those lower	221.08	4.359	1
by rounds whether or not they were	223.4	4.759	1
covering mid L maybe can read a bit into	225.44	5.08	1
it once they see it again all that	228.16	5.44	1
information helps so now what can L do	230.52	5.92	0
they tried the B stack that default take	233.6	4.72	0
on a for first round did not work but	236.44	3.561	1
they're going to heavy stack towards a	238.32	3.441	1
here as we get a bigger default from	240.0	3.76	1
Sentinels and I'm interested to see if	241.76	4.6	1
loud does a bit of the extremity pushing	243.76	4.759	1
here they need each other to get back	246.36	4.599	1
for this initiator utility on the retake	248.52	4.36	0
so losing somebody on a peak would be	250.96	3.881	0
detrimental to loud they're going to	252.88	6.04	1
stay back and play a very passive o game	254.84	6.28	1
except for that player except for that	258.92	4.641	1
two gets dropped instantly Sentinels	261.12	5.72	1
once again in a power play John Cy still	263.56	4.76	1
lurking around towards this B sign	266.84	2.919	1
trying to see if you can hear rotate out	268.32	3.439	0
of market so for sentinals it's still an	269.76	4.081	1
information game for loud it's the	271.76	3.481	1
aggression we talked about the	273.84	2.76	1
extremities but this time it's towards	275.24	3.92	1
the there's the contact on a few finally	276.6	5.159	1
gets traded out but we're even up on a	279.16	5.44	1
33 with Z heavily damaged and that lurk	281.76	5.041	1
though for John cue it's now open it's	284.6	3.879	1
up to sel to try to figure a way back	286.8	2.959	1
towards the B site to meet up against	288.48	2.961	1
the	289.76	4.921	1
igl going the long way around wouldn't	291.44	5.0	1
be able to clear mid and do not know	294.68	3.32	1
what breadcrumbs are left there from the	296.44	4.36	1
Cowen push yeah they right qck is able	298.0	5.039	1
to catch this audio and will take a shot	300.8	5.48	1
easy one placement Z low on HP actually	303.04	4.841	1
Dodges away from The Flash and made it	306.28	3.68	1
through getting a plant right now for	307.88	3.64	1
senal would be pretty	309.96	4.0	1
decent for this bonus round that they	311.52	5.6	1
have John C watching Z's back as a plant	313.96	5.56	0
Comes Down stink bite just dropping down	317.12	5.639	0
inches away at zin's feet and allows	319.52	4.679	0
both players now to group together	322.76	2.801	1
towards the back of the site they see	324.2	3.801	1
the Recon darts are rotate a flank from	325.56	4.479	1
sadak towards the B Main	328.0	4.36	1
qck no more flashes has to move together	330.04	3.481	1
they have to play the fundamentals now	332.36	3.839	1
for loud to blaze wall first but another	333.52	5.239	1
St Bight forcing John Cy out of position	336.2	5.161	1
a one for one solo second head shot on	338.76	5.44	1
the first but geted right away by Les a	341.36	5.52	0
nice trade for loud they convert their	344.2	5.401	0
gun round but SEL they are definitely	346.88	5.68	1
happy with that result loud securing	349.6	6.48	1
that one L with the viper bite on to Z	352.56	6.12	1
actually paying off in dividends as they	356.08	4.64	1
follow up on it but you're right so much	358.68	4.079	1
damage done from Sentinels loud are	360.72	4.08	1
going to have a bit of trouble reing	362.76	3.921	1
into this already see some Stingers on	364.8	4.36	1
the board as we rewatch this play again	366.68	5.32	1
good teamwork good trade fundamentals on	369.16	4.84	1
that one keep pressing W until you can	372.0	4.52	0
get your teammate anchored on that play	374.0	4.4	0
So a good post plant from loud we see	376.52	3.92	1
that	378.4	4.199	1
successful can they keep it up Phoenix	380.44	4.8	1
ultimate's up they may try to go for an	382.6	4.32	1
a push here as they already have that	385.24	4.399	1
sight quite stacked and the only one	386.92	4.361	1
that's going to be seen as	389.64	4.84	1
two L having to play once again a gamble	391.28	4.88	1
stack this time towards B because of	394.48	3.481	1
that bonus round that SEL had the	396.16	4.08	1
economy is very low the strongest weapon	397.96	4.359	1
was the one that was maintained by Les	400.24	4.079	1
on that previous round which is a vandal	402.32	3.241	1
and the rest are just looking for that	404.32	3.761	1
trap play it's up to loud once again to	405.56	4.479	1
do a lot more rotations around the side	408.08	3.559	1
have better reads but thankfully they	410.04	3.961	1
have a scan agent andot who's currently	411.64	5.041	1
joining towards the B main spots nothing	414.0	4.4	1
this is good for Sentinel to work the	416.68	4.72	1
map	418.4	3.0	1
what a choice John QD again calling it	421.48	5.72	1
shots the left side of the map here	424.68	4.28	0
obviously a retake for loud but this	427.2	3.961	0
should be Sentinels planting pushing	428.96	3.44	1
forward and actually gaining some	431.16	3.68	1
position so loud cannot do anything	432.4	4.88	0
really here on the retake the way	434.84	4.84	0
Sentinels have been approaching each of	437.28	4.639	1
their games it seems like they have two	439.68	4.56	1
variations they can use whether it is 10	441.92	4.68	1
on the omen where they they they play a	444.24	3.88	1
game that's centered around this	446.6	3.28	1
crowding up getting into the sight	448.12	3.359	1
together and just	449.88	5.201	1
swarming s a top of the head of s Falls	451.48	5.4	1
at least for allow they have this	455.08	4.6	1
running back with qck hoping that sedak	456.88	4.16	0
was still alive to help with the Recon	459.68	2.959	1
Dart but it's going to make it a little	461.04	3.481	1
bit more difficult for loud to retake	462.64	4.28	0
the site J CU already setting up with	464.52	3.679	1
the camera so that's going to be the	466.92	2.641	1
first Contact the rest of the team	468.2	3.241	1
holding back towards be main looking to	469.56	4.4	1
just Spam if loud make it through make	471.44	5.039	1
it through the first line of contact	473.96	5.84	1
John cuy back Beautiful by celsus it	476.48	5.72	1
allows for him to get the kill onto less	479.8	4.959	1
there's qk upgrading weapon M onto the	482.2	4.12	1
ground the Lays coming out from SEL that	484.76	3.28	1
clock is ticking down here pains on top	486.32	3.921	1
of that nice shot though from T as	488.04	4.16	1
they're leading forward boom to get more	490.24	4.2	1
scans s dropping two in a beautiful hole	492.2	5.041	0
for s in the end not even worrying about	494.44	4.319	0
the smokes that can come through they	497.24	3.76	0
have all the utility and weaponry to	498.76	4.56	0
fire back on to loud and that low by	501.0	4.0	1
hurts all the damage sen did on the	503.32	4.16	1
bonus round hurts and they pick up a	505.0	5.84	1
third round now and that that was that	507.48	5.0	1
that was the one variation of the hit	510.84	3.48	1
where they can follow zekin in they can	512.48	4.081	1
make it work on a map like Sunset and	514.32	4.24	1
then klin can switch up the team and you	516.56	4.919	1
can get a bind out of this squad that	518.56	5.0	1
has a yoru forend where they're pushing	521.48	4.401	1
everywhere they know how to flex and	523.56	4.56	1
flow between play Styles so well when	525.88	3.92	1
they get on different agents Sentinels	528.12	3.64	1
is just showing different this year but	529.8	3.92	1
we got a whole series to go through and	531.76	4.36	1
Loud has showed us just as much this	533.72	5.119	1
season coming into round five this til	536.12	6.399	1
push is is louds again but T answers two	538.84	4.641	1
right	542.52	3.681	1
away but tuis did get a timing he made	543.48	4.599	0
it through that's going to catched on CU	546.2	4.079	1
that's allowing to even up the tally for	548.08	3.841	1
the mid-ring to start a little bit	550.28	4.481	1
earlier Les even once more no pun	551.92	5.0	1
intended as we have a fight now towards	554.76	6.4	1
the a main side instantly leaving sashy	556.92	7.28	1
alone and they may even taster choice	561.16	5.04	1
this and by that I mean who's going to	564.2	3.72	1
kill Sashi do you get an ALT on sadak do	566.2	3.879	1
you get an ALT on l is it different do	567.92	3.599	1
you let him get it down and get the alts	570.08	2.841	1
that way loud's going to be able to	571.52	3.121	1
circulate these alts in the next few	572.92	3.72	0
rounds sashy gets the plant and	574.64	3.56	0
beautiful that he can work off of it	576.64	3.6	1
with wingman here trash is available if	578.2	5.24	1
this goes down Sashi may go all out that	580.24	4.68	0
would be such a gamble but look at him	583.44	3.72	0
it here all these rotates so he's trying	584.92	3.479	0
to get an angle he's trying to get a	587.16	3.119	0
surprise attack here's our first jump	588.4	3.801	0
spot here's two crossing over the third	590.28	4.161	0
one already made it through so Sassi now	592.2	4.24	1
has a timing behind the three players	594.44	3.68	0
allowed roach it in across there's a	596.44	3.2	0
stake by towards M now	598.12	3.92	1
Watchers two and he will have all the	599.64	4.8	1
kit left now on his Geo kit the mar	602.04	4.32	1
going down Force the halfway out of	604.44	4.44	1
position now Les Falls away there's that	606.36	3.919	1
thrash coming out too from the front of	608.88	3.079	1
the pillar and Les even has to pull back	610.28	3.481	1
towards the market it does not hit him	611.96	5.12	1
though but that clock is taken down s r	613.76	6.639	1
for the time gets it done and Sass wins	617.08	7.361	1
a three on one against	620.4	8.361	1
loud incredible play from sashy you can	624.44	6.8	1
look at any player on this team and find	628.76	4.04	1
that type of play coming out of	631.24	6.48	1
Sentinels here absolutely routing loud	632.8	7.08	1
listen to that	637.72	5.64	1
crowd the Saucy call outs come out as	639.88	6.639	1
his plays go down what a pivotal kill	643.36	6.159	1
two for 10s for Sentinels to understand	646.52	6.081	1
the tiles push has been such a priority	649.52	5.921	1
for L they instantly attack back snap	652.6	5.32	1
back at L's push when qck comes around	655.44	4.32	1
the corner and	657.92	6.0	1
yeah they're feeling that what a play	659.76	5.92	1
from	663.92	4.359	1
Sassi absolutely throwing loud's timing	665.68	4.36	1
off by the wingman plant and push into	668.28	4.281	1
to Market very heady play we're in round	670.04	5.08	1
six now a mid playay from loud thinking	672.56	4.2	1
that Sentinels might go for this	675.12	3.24	1
encroachment again they have a lot that	676.76	2.8	1
they can work behind this wall that they	678.36	2.88	1
just put up there goes that curveball	679.56	5.12	1
out for qck but do we still fell first s	681.24	4.68	1
are just anching around they have	684.68	3.08	1
support from all angles control it in	685.92	4.76	1
the middle kn chance	687.76	5.4	1
for through a mid	690.68	6.279	1
flood with that hat thrown here by joh	693.16	5.96	1
gives enough information that a site is	696.96	4.201	0
open it's weaker where sedak is	699.12	4.2	0
currently only holding with the sheriff	701.16	3.679	0
even sels they're giving him that	703.32	3.28	0
respect moving all the way together	704.84	5.401	0
forming up forming up ORS rather really	706.6	8.12	0
just working the protocols for the later	710.24	4.48	1
rounds just the smoke giving them pawn	714.88	5.28	1
shop control they know Sak right	717.52	5.361	1
there and another quick wingman plant	720.16	4.88	1
giving Sentinels so much safety never	722.88	4.84	0
having to push into the sight remain	725.04	4.32	1
somehow sedak had an opener had an	727.72	4.239	0
opportunity to drop JN cue but it's a NL	729.36	6.2	0
battle won by Sentinels yeah and last	731.96	5.68	1
again potentially in a situation yeah	735.56	3.2	1
you already see him back it up he's	737.64	3.481	1
going to save this one money wasn't too	738.76	4.199	1
great here for alloud and his half by	741.12	4.24	1
that they had trap play was read by	742.96	4.801	1
Sentinels exactly louder doing	745.36	4.36	1
everything they can to get under the	747.76	3.96	1
skin of Sentinels find that first kill	749.72	4.239	1
so they might be able to grab zel's	751.72	3.919	1
Vandal or whatever he would have in the	753.96	3.961	1
round and then move it around again	755.64	4.121	1
right see what Les can get see what can	757.92	5.2	1
happen Sentinels is avoiding it though	759.76	5.36	1
they're understanding and respecting the	763.12	3.8	1
fact that loud can still do a lot of	765.12	3.92	1
damage on these Low by rounds and you're	766.92	4.76	1
not seeing any wide swings that don't	769.04	4.44	1
have an anchor of a sentinel member on	771.68	4.56	1
it very controlled play Here by send	773.48	4.0	1
understanding their wing condition and	776.24	4.0	1
holding it close to the chest four	777.48	4.799	0
ultimates for loud very big swing point	780.24	4.12	1
in the game we get another timeout right	782.28	4.761	1
away oh my gosh should be the first one	784.36	6.56	1
here after all okay okay yeah so now	787.04	4.919	1
just trying to figure out what they can	790.92	2.68	1
do with this	791.96	4.041	1
probably as we had an inkling that a	793.6	3.599	1
timeout should have come out on that	796.0	3.16	1
previous round that lower buy that we	797.2	3.44	1
had from loud is just for him to decide	799.16	3.0	0
okay we got four alss to work with this	800.64	4.361	0
time around but that doesn't take away	802.16	4.2	1
any of the point that you mentioned so	805.0	4.399	1
far with that the ski round loss in a	806.36	5.32	0
row you're going to get 2900 into the	809.4	4.88	1
pockets of loud that's basically on no	811.68	4.68	1
credits is they have to spend in again	814.28	4.12	1
they need to use these ultimates to get	816.36	3.88	1
some rounds back now or it's going to	818.4	4.8	1
start swinging very heavily in favor of	820.24	5.24	1
sen already they swing heavily over	823.2	4.841	1
towards the right side to pressure main	825.48	5.279	1
pop flash going right into back alley	828.04	4.239	1
and it definitely looks like for louds	830.76	2.681	1
side they want to try to use that right	832.28	2.68	1
away there's the p on the first one	833.44	3.519	1
already the ig's backing up trying to	834.96	3.841	1
get the hury out and there it is it does	836.96	4.12	1
get a ping on a feud and with flashes	838.8	3.92	1
coming across it does get contact for	841.08	4.281	0
Ping but Zen still opens up Sentinels	842.72	4.44	1
were working towards the midside after a	845.36	4.2	0
trap play attempted by L with these alss	847.16	4.08	0
now Les is going to be in heavy trouble	849.56	3.839	1
towards the market he's there alone and	851.24	3.599	1
he's just trying to Anchor up at least	853.4	4.36	1
one portion of this bite towards the map	854.84	4.68	1
while the rest are pushing double	857.76	4.041	0
towards aong zelus is currently waiting	859.52	3.961	0
he lost his teammate in the process but	861.8	3.479	0
he gets the Dink and the kill on to tuis	863.48	3.68	1
the flash turns away from it and does	865.28	4.12	0
not connect on the second one Cowen	867.16	4.64	0
walks outway out of that fight limping	869.4	4.041	0
away but still has that support from	871.8	4.0	1
sadak three on three now in the mid	873.44	5.72	1
round finding fights around the map loud	875.8	5.92	1
trying to pick apart at sentinel's Team	879.16	4.64	1
before they hit these sights finally we	881.72	3.4	1
just talked about it they couldn't find	883.8	3.0	1
any ground before it always be quickly	885.12	4.88	1
traded back now the 3v3	886.8	6.52	0
stands unless gets traded out yep in	890.0	5.32	0
these moments during this kickoff has	893.32	4.079	1
been so good and he anchored position to	895.32	4.519	1
drop two and three has been a superstar	897.4	5.761	1
player but now SEL coming out this	899.84	5.68	1
game the basics the fundamentals are	903.16	4.0	1
looking very good to get	905.52	4.841	1
a coming out looking around the	907.16	6.0	0
TP Co moving forward looks like tens is	910.36	4.2	0
looking for a fight he gets punished	913.16	3.0	0
right away by sadak as the Rolling	914.56	3.76	1
Thunder comes out now even the P comes	916.16	5.239	1
out beautiful combination of utility	918.32	6.72	1
from loud as they drop zasi and come in	921.4	5.481	1
for the diffuse and we talked about how	925.04	4.919	1
big this round was loud stays off going	926.88	5.519	1
into economy hell right now that was	929.96	4.56	1
such a big round Sentinels would have	932.4	4.12	1
been running away with a few more and	934.52	3.481	1
this first half would have not looked	936.52	4.161	1
good now we have loud coming back up	938.0	4.199	1
here still going to be a buy coming in	940.68	3.68	1
from sen it seems yeah they should be	942.2	3.681	1
able to get that low armor	944.36	5.599	1
in see this again too the the retake it	945.88	7.48	1
had to happen for loud to use the the	949.96	5.841	1
the Rolling Thunder everything they had	953.36	5.08	1
it was according to the play this had to	955.8	4.24	1
be be	958.44	4.56	1
secured oh Saucy not get out of that one	960.04	5.08	1
you see they're still vibing loud knows	963.0	4.319	1
this game isn't out of hand it's not	965.12	4.639	1
crazy the few rounds down means nothing	967.32	5.241	1
to sadak and Loud still very much in it	969.76	5.0	1
and let's see how they play that always	972.56	4.279	0
on ph the judg is there for sedak so you	974.76	3.401	0
know they're starting to get a little	976.84	3.161	1
ratty on these we'll see how that gets	978.16	4.799	1
used and these ultimates as well QC K	980.0	5.519	1
can still go in a quick retake and Les	982.96	4.841	1
just pushes him out with the Viper pit	985.52	4.521	0
we have yet to see how loud actually	987.8	4.64	0
fight back with those you see loud	990.04	4.32	0
though just jingling across the contact	992.44	3.56	0
being those controllers Less in the back	994.36	5.32	1
of the site two on the a site it looks	996.0	5.759	0
like senel want to activate right away	999.68	4.88	0
they com in out from zelus second	1001.76	5.401	0
Satchel to cross contact on players from	1004.56	4.48	0
loud in the back of Boba as a plant	1007.16	3.239	1
comes in for sental it's time for them	1009.04	3.239	1
to play the pulse plant once again but	1010.4	3.56	1
this time around nobody holding yet	1012.28	3.081	1
towards the back of the B main it's a	1013.96	3.24	1
paranoid to push through and you hear	1015.36	4.159	0
that run it back should come across the	1017.2	5.161	0
save comes out from Les as it allows qyk	1019.52	5.001	0
to stay alive a whole roster of loud	1022.36	4.079	1
against three left of Sentinels paranoia	1024.52	3.6	1
being thrown on defense there's that	1026.44	3.441	1
judge more utility flooding towards the	1028.12	4.079	1
front but celsus and tense are holding	1029.88	4.0	0
back their ground for now beautiful	1032.2	4.48	1
flash out fromus though now the tap on	1033.88	4.28	1
the spike trying to draw out the	1036.68	3.721	1
opponents beautifully done by	1038.16	4.72	1
loud they come in for the diffuse and	1040.4	5.12	1
you saw some hope there from zelus and	1042.88	5.319	1
10 and Loud instantly they held back for	1045.52	5.2	1
a Split Second four Sentinels out and	1048.2	4.001	1
finally played the fundamentals in won	1050.72	4.319	1
the round that's the loud train I think	1052.2	5.04	1
we've been looking for it took a little	1055.04	4.801	1
bit to stoke the fire but man coming	1057.24	4.52	1
down the tracks you do not want to be in	1059.84	3.719	1
the way of loud when they feel like the	1061.76	4.039	1
retake is going	1063.56	5.801	1
100% the way they came through Boba here	1065.8	7.561	1
just Fearless as it were as sedak says	1069.36	6.559	1
La just run right into B main the last	1073.36	4.439	1
time we saw that fight Sentinels was	1075.92	5.081	0
just Laing loud as they tried to come	1077.8	5.161	0
into B main they didn't even make it	1081.0	4.72	1
loud gained so much ground there	1082.96	4.44	1
completely taking Sentinels by surprise	1085.72	4.04	1
we set up for Sen in a bit of the same	1087.4	4.56	1
formation but less movement they're not	1089.76	3.72	1
taking as much of	1091.96	4.92	1
Market supressed the wall that they just	1093.48	5.199	0
dealt with there in B main usually can	1096.88	3.72	1
mean someone pushes up so you have to	1098.68	4.961	1
worry loud is giving send a lot of	1100.6	5.439	1
things to worry about here and with	1103.64	4.2	1
Dizzy down they're going to be able to	1106.04	3.961	1
have a little m in control but not sight	1107.84	5.839	0
yet s's just trying to play into loud's	1110.0	5.44	0
style where when they get pressure on	1113.68	3.401	0
one side they usually push the extremity	1115.44	3.16	1
on the other so you already see tens	1117.08	3.92	1
holding back towards the a main side all	1118.6	3.68	1
the way from Spawn trying to catch a	1121.0	3.159	1
forward push but nobody's really moving	1122.28	3.519	1
here from loud they held things back	1124.16	3.081	1
towards the B site they haven't really	1125.8	3.921	1
fully rotated and for them they're just	1127.24	4.2	1
very much still comfortable of playing	1129.72	4.52	1
that retake style uh towards this a sign	1131.44	4.28	0
for senal they regrouped after that	1134.24	3.16	0
after deniability that you saw there	1135.72	5.52	0
from less his utility with his	1137.4	7.24	0
teammates sen is looking to fit back	1141.24	5.76	1
toying with the door just hoping loud	1144.64	4.919	0
will have to keep covering Market there	1147.0	4.52	1
as they start to make their way zelus	1149.56	3.441	1
knife came up just a bit ago as they	1151.52	3.2	1
enter the a main area but this is a	1153.0	3.44	1
contact play they want to see how loud	1154.72	4.36	1
reacts to this and finally after the	1156.44	4.359	1
first SM comes out on the defense the	1159.08	3.0	1
other one goes out towards the spawn on	1160.8	3.521	1
the attack now you're not allowing here	1162.08	4.36	1
at twois to get the high stack and a	1164.32	4.8	0
spray with his Vandal which allows here	1166.44	6.92	0
a wingman to get a very Le plant towards	1169.12	4.24	1
a how far do they push forward little	1173.68	5.321	1
hide here from second right under the	1176.48	5.199	1
trash can John QD is going to be	1179.0	4.88	1
flanking far but it's watched by sedak	1181.68	4.161	0
What's the timing here loud comes	1183.88	3.4	1
through spawn through a whole flash	1185.84	2.68	1
towards the air just to try to slow it	1187.28	2.759	1
down for a bit just trying to take down	1188.52	3.32	1
Sak first to push towards that spawn it	1190.04	3.241	1
works out another one fell within the	1191.84	4.68	1
sight for loud loud have regain control	1193.28	5.12	1
of that b site the tap to flush out	1196.52	4.12	1
Sentinels once again double back towards	1198.4	4.04	1
the default box as last lines up two	1200.64	4.039	1
kills somehow and the spray comes back	1202.44	3.719	1
here through the cages but it's going to	1204.68	4.401	1
be difficult right now Sashi does get	1206.16	4.64	1
the pick the last one still sticks to	1209.08	2.92	1
the	1210.8	3.76	1
fuse not planed for them to be to play	1212.0	4.44	1
that push forward they really had to	1214.56	3.681	1
walk in the sight and L was always ready	1216.44	3.56	1
for that pretty wild damage from	1218.24	3.799	1
Sentinels though coming out with some	1220.0	5.6	1
pist on that round they drop all of loud	1222.04	5.161	1
loud and the fans happy though to pick	1225.6	3.04	1
up another round like we said even	1227.2	3.16	1
looking at five been showing up as well	1228.64	4.32	1
for Sentinels this season so we get back	1230.36	5.64	1
in also decided not to play the ascent	1232.96	5.48	1
in this Grand finals they didn't that	1236.0	5.6	1
the fact that we had ice box in here and	1238.44	4.76	0
S have been kind of kicking that out of	1241.6	3.28	0
the pool was very interesting I cannot	1243.2	5.599	0
wait but on Sunset until it does just	1244.88	6.799	0
that round 10 monster on the loose uhoh	1248.8	4.801	0
thrash right off the rip how does loud	1251.68	3.921	0
respond to an instant aggression tried	1253.6	4.72	0
to get a camera uh pivot towards the mid	1255.6	5.16	1
and zelus already fell now just spraying	1258.32	4.479	1
across here and gets a lucky kill onto a	1260.76	4.039	1
second that second that falls he's he	1262.8	4.801	1
get a plant now Hunter's Fury coming out	1264.8	4.961	1
from the defense of ping does get the	1267.6	4.84	1
hit onto John cue from	1269.76	5.159	1
qck as here's a shot from behind to lur	1272.44	5.04	1
once again Sashi gets it done TS under	1274.92	4.041	1
heavy pressure alone towards the back of	1277.48	3.64	0
the site thrash being picked up the TP	1278.96	3.88	1
away from one sees the second one and it	1281.12	2.84	1
does get the hit here that's going to	1282.84	3.8	1
delay even more sedak is detained tu's	1283.96	4.52	1
had to TP away and now they finally	1286.64	3.399	1
regroup they don't have too much utility	1288.48	3.199	1
but these smokes T is already pushing	1290.04	3.361	1
towards that spike a beautiful Dy	1291.68	4.24	1
allowing T to get that pick up to sedak	1293.4	5.32	1
alone a nice shot there from pens once	1295.92	5.76	1
again leading out for the kill and SEL	1298.72	4.439	1
finally get another point he threw that	1301.68	3.6	1
through the window right yep oh we	1303.16	4.4	1
hardly ever get to see the windows used	1305.28	4.64	1
awesome stuff from	1307.56	4.921	0
Market honestly little things like that	1309.92	4.281	0
you hardly see in your games are the	1312.48	3.48	0
ones that can catch you off guard in a	1314.2	5.079	0
millisecond oh my gosh	1315.96	5.48	1
one eny wait a minute yeah there's a	1319.28	6.321	1
window vent that TS vent s and that's	1321.44	6.88	1
going to be the end 64 the timeout pays	1325.6	5.6	1
off for Sentinels here big time after	1328.32	5.52	1
three post plant rounds successful in a	1331.2	6.28	1
row low seems the game plan got foiled	1333.84	5.319	1
but thankfully you still have players	1337.48	3.76	1
that could really think on their toes	1339.16	4.601	0
though with how tens and Sassy play that	1341.24	4.08	0
one because he lost a lot of players in	1343.76	2.84	0
the process trying to play this they're	1345.32	3.64	1
trying to play a contact towards the a	1346.6	5.52	1
sight gets dropped the L by from L you	1348.96	6.199	1
saw the Bucky TP towards the back Thea	1352.12	5.039	1
is there for the support still holding	1355.16	3.481	1
towards the back of the a site that hat	1357.16	3.601	1
is going to help a lot neural theft out	1358.64	3.919	1
it's a forward push here from Les	1360.76	3.72	0
outside the B site while the rest are	1362.56	4.161	0
pinged out all around the a site but for	1364.48	5.0	0
Sentinels it's a cut noise just want to	1366.72	4.36	1
reset for a bit here with a minute left	1369.48	4.799	1
on the clock I like the movement Les	1371.08	4.36	1
said all right we're getting pinged I'm	1374.28	2.601	1
going to get out here and kill the Trap	1375.44	3.359	1
it at B Main	1376.88	3.84	1
just to make John Cy think a little bit	1378.8	3.721	0
more so John always watching the flank	1380.72	4.52	0
though they have to watch for Less could	1382.52	4.519	0
be a fer in this round that just closes	1385.24	4.679	1
it out oh the Ang the whole time and now	1387.04	6.201	1
get all here comes the bom the M towards	1389.92	6.0	1
the back of the side contact on while	1393.24	4.72	1
the rest of the SEL were	1395.92	5.681	1
there just to get the driveby firing	1397.96	6.28	1
squad leaving Les	1401.6	5.559	1
alone yeah he broke one trip on the B	1404.24	4.84	1
site but couldn't get one on the a side	1407.16	4.4	1
so his cover is	1409.08	4.8	1
blown to keep away but that's Ace shot	1411.56	5.401	1
off and now no one else Peaks versus one	1413.88	5.32	0
holding a tight angle as set kin goes	1416.96	4.599	1
for the crabwalk though and he'll get	1419.2	6.64	0
the pick seven to four now last round	1421.56	8.12	1
Sentinels great control here kind of	1425.84	6.16	1
activating un loud so quick it almost	1429.68	3.88	1
look like loud fell asleep at the wheel	1432.0	3.52	0
for a second that's just the timing	1433.56	4.321	0
wasn't there Sentinels get a Thanos	1435.52	4.759	0
timing walking into elbow here Sai drops	1437.88	7.48	0
qck no flash and this what three a crowd	1440.28	7.201	1
that was so unlucky there for loud	1445.36	4.04	1
because they were anticipating that hit	1447.48	4.64	1
from SEL you saw who was I think it was	1449.4	4.92	1
C looking towards the a with a frenzy	1452.12	4.2	1
getting ready to hit that but hit both	1454.32	3.52	1
of his teammates even all three before	1456.32	3.839	1
but let's hold that thought Sher already	1457.84	4.68	1
out outside of the gates and blow Sedar	1460.16	3.561	1
to	1462.52	4.6	1
bits once again numbers Advantage for	1463.72	4.88	1
Sentinels Al allwing for them to work	1467.12	4.32	1
the map working back towards his BS side	1468.6	4.88	1
and right there I hope I have enough	1471.44	4.239	1
time to say this never mind not at all	1473.48	3.52	1
paranoia going back and forth just to	1475.68	3.521	1
try to delay towards the market but	1477.0	4.64	1
still allowing sentinals to gain space	1479.2	4.92	1
and a plant attempt as we went for	1481.64	3.919	1
attack first and lost players towards	1484.12	3.2	1
the market side sash is still alive at	1485.56	4.84	1
that spot though we try to hold it back	1487.32	5.839	1
finally successful for the	1490.4	5.361	1
sentinals smoke to just to help s a	1493.16	4.601	0
little bit towards the market L just	1495.76	3.56	1
winning here for that fight coming out	1497.76	4.88	1
from qck it's slow but it's coming as a	1499.32	4.76	1
dizzy comes up just to try to delay	1502.64	2.68	1
towards the back of the site even more	1504.08	3.04	1
finally that contact as you mentioned	1505.32	4.079	1
second season flates coming out there's	1507.12	4.76	1
that execution now for S back and forth	1509.4	4.52	1
but still the advantage for the attack	1511.88	4.76	1
side as they know it was that flanker	1513.92	4.921	1
qck with no utility after he uses his	1516.64	5.159	1
wall contact out to sasi allowing here a	1518.84	4.76	1
second just to wait for the tap pain	1521.8	3.721	1
shells to keep him at Bay that will	1523.6	3.24	1
definitely end the half right now	1525.52	2.8	1
especially with that	1526.84	3.92	1
coming out from Saia SS to close out the	1528.32	4.28	0
half with a four-point	1530.76	4.279	1
lead second us an ALT there at the	1532.6	4.439	1
beginning of the round the pressures	1535.04	4.481	1
created it's been such a different in	1537.04	4.24	1
that sense of ultimates being used right	1539.52	4.12	1
off the rip all of sck's hunters uh the	1541.28	4.161	1
hunters Furies came at the beginning of	1543.64	3.8	1
the round came to try and discombobulate	1545.44	4.119	1
what Sentinels was doing and they only	1547.44	4.32	1
had to slightly respect it cuz they can	1549.56	4.681	1
dodge it Z comes in you have to respect	1551.76	4.68	1
it the fundamental differences in the	1554.24	5.28	1
power that these comps can hit with is	1556.44	5.16	1
huge and we'll see that as loud comes on	1559.52	3.6	1
the attack side now it takes so much	1561.6	3.72	1
more to orchestrate this composition	1563.12	4.2	1
into a sight you definitely see a lot	1565.32	3.2	1
from all of these players right about	1567.32	3.68	1
that meta the battle of the igls the big	1568.52	4.56	1
brains from the coaching staff it's also	1571.0	3.64	1
just a heads sub play from all these	1573.08	3.76	1
players that has been looking so good in	1574.64	3.68	1
this first half and speaking of	1576.84	3.88	1
information to react right away a knife	1578.32	4.359	1
went out towards the as sign pinging a	1580.72	4.679	1
few here thrown by zelus and SEL knows	1582.68	4.48	1
as hits coming towards the aide and	1585.4	3.921	1
they're ready for this signature retake	1587.16	4.601	1
play style on the a site loud still	1589.32	4.28	1
deciding to work towards a though so	1591.76	3.21	0
they might have something back in	1593.6	3.679	0
[Applause]	1594.97	4.39	0
return what are we working with there	1597.28	3.681	0
are some ghosts so a little bit of a	1599.36	3.64	0
drop on util there classics will be able	1600.96	4.599	0
to come in full utility wise and the	1603.0	5.36	1
early delay early fakes with a bit of	1605.56	4.441	1
utility here I wonder if that's going to	1608.36	4.64	1
allow s in a bit more but this is louder	1610.0	4.32	1
hunger down here it's going to be hard	1613.0	3.08	1
to get them out parano and dizzy that's	1614.32	3.28	1
going to hit Fus runs inside the smoke	1616.08	4.24	1
the boom even SPS him and blows him away	1617.6	4.72	0
flash towards the back coward Z's fully	1620.32	3.88	1
blinded but is okay to stay behind the	1622.32	4.2	1
smoke attack onto the spike a FL line	1624.2	4.04	1
coming out a spray through the smoke a	1626.52	3.759	1
spray and pray and for L to hopefully	1628.24	4.08	1
get this pistol on their side it's not	1630.28	4.601	1
even halfway the oh the wingman already	1632.32	5.56	1
got fed but there's no time left there's	1634.88	6.82	1
no time left in front right clicks	1637.88	5.88	1
[Applause]	1641.7	4.62	1
what oh this is going to be the type of	1643.76	4.279	1
place that we're going to see in a p SM	1646.32	3.64	1
plays between loud and	1648.04	4.161	1
Sentinels we're going to be on Ed they	1649.96	4.719	1
they call that Cinema no just kidding	1652.2	4.959	1
that was the uh that was the Tuesday mat	1654.68	5.72	1
night that was absolute	1657.16	7.88	1
chaos oh my gosh did that's the I have	1660.4	7.241	1
one final Choice moment situations	1665.04	4.24	1
everybody's doing the final thing they	1667.64	3.759	1
know they're going to go down and that	1669.28	4.52	1
one was to jump through the smoke and	1671.4	3.921	1
finally kill the diffuser even though it	1673.8	2.681	1
probably wouldn't have been half that	1675.32	2.8	0
was just the kind of situation	1676.48	3.64	0
the pressure loud puts on the first	1678.12	3.64	0
attack round of their pistol here second	1680.12	3.36	1
half a big push here from Sentinels	1681.76	3.799	1
though this is going to be another War	1683.48	3.52	1
continuing with the double flash	1685.56	3.561	1
combination from the initiators but qck	1687.0	4.2	1
is just ready for that so that only does	1689.12	4.36	1
he stops to push from SEL but that's	1691.2	3.56	1
building up his ultimate here for the	1693.48	2.799	1
later rounds even trying to clear for	1694.76	3.44	1
more grabbing the or behind the all	1696.28	3.921	0
drone wouldn't be surprised if they just	1698.2	3.52	0
give him a plan or he just chases the	1700.2	3.599	1
kill but you're seeing like sentinals	1701.72	4.04	1
are trying to rework the map somewhere	1703.8	4.641	1
go head to-head Omen versus tues gets	1705.76	5.68	1
the upper hand of	1708.44	5.56	1
T actually did see qk trying to hunt for	1711.44	4.8	1
more kills there he got instantly Ned by	1714.0	4.559	1
sashy camera will let them know they can	1716.24	5.559	1
end at a on this one in loud I I feel	1718.56	5.84	1
like needed to start setting the pace as	1721.8	5.561	1
they got onto this attack side Sentinels	1724.4	5.12	1
as they were on attack like I said what	1727.36	4.08	1
didn't care when the hunters Fury came	1729.52	3.481	1
out from loud they were able to work	1731.44	4.28	1
around it absorb loud utility at market	1733.0	5.72	1
and hit a or the other way around A to B	1735.72	6.36	1
here loud cannot let Sentinel set up a	1738.72	5.439	1
defensive spot loud needs to be in their	1742.08	4.28	1
face all the time and again with this	1744.16	4.601	1
composition loud has that has to be	1746.36	4.52	1
everybody behind qck right qck is not	1748.76	4.639	1
blast packing in he's not dashing in	1750.88	4.24	1
Stand they have to go in together and	1753.4	3.12	1
right now they're picking these rounds	1755.12	3.96	1
up together yeah I mean as much as SEL	1756.52	4.28	0
has utility to retake these sights for	1759.08	3.439	0
alloud side they have as much s right	1760.8	2.921	1
they have the fault line to come out	1762.52	3.481	1
they have the over the smokes they have	1763.72	3.799	1
paranoia if they haven't used it forly	1766.0	3.72	1
takes it comes down to how they work the	1767.52	5.0	1
map once again here on the attack senel	1769.72	4.199	1
might have to try to change things a	1772.52	3.081	1
little bit here as they	1773.92	4.961	1
have a good round to come	1775.6	5.079	1
through that's for them to try to	1778.88	3.08	1
control something I wonder if they	1780.68	4.641	1
Sentinels try a trap play right away go	1781.96	4.839	1
for their own better guns than this with	1785.32	3.28	1
better guns than this	1786.8	4.72	1
yeah cuz it would be good against	1788.6	6.28	1
loud if if if loud were to go slow on	1791.52	5.801	1
around might be this thinking the low	1794.88	6.039	1
Low by is going to create a tough tough	1797.32	5.8	1
entry into the Sight Four towards a for	1800.92	4.201	1
loud heavy side as well for Sentinels	1803.12	4.52	1
strong side rather looks like up and	1805.12	4.24	1
over flash by Dizzy No they I don't	1807.64	4.24	1
think they've thrown anything yet heard	1809.36	3.96	1
a Flash coming out from zelus just to	1811.88	3.6	1
delay a bit though big paranoia fast	1813.32	4.88	1
again yeah boombod Z satchels away T's	1815.48	4.199	1
trying to swing back out just to try to	1818.2	3.64	1
catch Q off guard a knife is going to	1819.68	4.12	1
delay that utility that would allow for	1821.84	3.76	1
LA to gain that momentum gain that space	1823.8	4.081	1
that it gain towards the elbow SEL wants	1825.6	3.64	1
to fight back the aggression comes	1827.88	3.72	1
through Q still on the top a stier close	1829.24	5.24	1
range the celus for the classic H hands	1831.6	4.84	0
on the ground finally T takes him down	1834.48	4.079	1
and all the rest of loud Falls as twois	1836.44	4.839	1
was looking for that lurk and sels they	1838.56	4.72	1
fight back on the gun round they realize	1841.28	4.841	1
it's going to be chaos saner just as as	1843.28	4.721	1
hard and weird and fast right there as	1846.12	4.2	1
loud as trying to Hit That Elbow spot	1848.0	4.679	1
also take a little Pawn control and it	1850.32	4.76	1
is taking control to kind of organize	1852.68	4.281	1
this mess that's going on the nades that	1855.08	3.52	1
are being being thrown that first	1856.96	4.36	0
allowed this Long Peak to come through	1858.6	4.559	0
with qck there they knew they needed to	1861.32	4.359	1
get him out of the situation unroot him	1863.16	4.321	1
it just caused the push Sentinels is	1865.68	4.321	1
there numbers cuz they did choose the	1867.48	5.919	1
right sight expecting loud to hit a	1870.0	5.399	1
sometimes at some point those paint	1873.4	3.961	1
shells went down there from Zin and Q	1875.4	3.801	1
somehow still stood alive so you jump up	1877.36	4.319	1
on the box as fast as possible it's	1879.2	5.24	1
definitely difficult there for SEL are	1881.68	4.401	1
try to regain the elbow side but they	1884.44	3.959	1
did power numbers	1886.08	4.599	1
now we have a tech pause coming out here	1888.4	3.721	1
but it's quick you know didn't even have	1890.68	3.281	1
a chance to talk about it wow that's	1892.12	5.08	1
even better all right cool I'll take	1893.96	6.24	1
that any day now and just making sure	1897.2	5.319	1
Tech pause works right Tech pause the	1900.2	5.439	1
tech pause Le loud right now still has	1902.52	5.681	1
this run it back here that they could	1905.64	5.16	1
use they're adding that pressure on this	1908.2	5.56	1
a side to start even trying to see if	1910.8	4.6	1
there's going to be a push from s down	1913.76	4.159	1
towards the middle for a link control	1915.4	3.76	1
senel on their end though they're	1917.92	3.48	1
looking for once again the first Contact	1919.16	3.721	1
towards the front zel's with the support	1921.4	3.4	1
and the flashes on the back of the	1922.88	4.159	0
dumpster so they could fight back that's	1924.8	3.88	0
all they want to do so	1927.04	4.081	0
far when they spray it across they	1928.68	4.161	0
didn't hear anybody from loud shooting	1931.12	3.32	0
back so he might be able to start to	1932.84	3.4	0
Pivot back and work towards the side how	1934.44	3.28	0
about John cue it's the first time that	1936.24	3.439	0
we'll see loud start to use this wall	1937.72	3.6	0
here that kind of helps them get an	1939.68	4.72	0
entrance mostly for qck and and kenen to	1941.32	4.319	0
flash through then they can enter	1944.4	3.64	0
through their own wall and they have to	1945.64	4.561	0
make Sentinels worry thr comes flying	1948.04	4.12	0
out from sa to check mid control grabs	1950.2	5.079	0
one mark it Satchel still alive coming	1952.16	4.601	1
back but his teammate the Tain cannot	1955.28	4.321	1
really help get Mar comes down the Tom	1956.76	4.879	1
one celus gets the head shot T's ready	1959.6	4.64	1
for p Let's It Rip but the rest of loud	1961.64	3.88	0
made it through towards the Beast site	1964.24	3.12	0
nonetheless they gave up on that control	1965.52	3.321	0
towards the market the plant coming down	1967.36	3.919	0
here for cine hit by flashes all over	1968.84	4.88	0
faroud as sels are still out back on the	1971.28	4.601	1
outside by middle and B there's that	1973.72	6.12	1
fight to CAU it oh my God it all around	1975.88	6.0	1
leing now Les alone on the one versus	1979.84	5.439	1
four positioned now towards the Spike as	1981.88	5.88	1
at least the thrash is on spot him now	1985.28	4.441	1
back and forth we go and zelus gets	1987.76	5.32	1
another backstab 10 is ready to come out	1989.72	5.04	1
strong in his Grand finals as well it's	1993.08	5.4	1
been an incredible year for 10 so far we	1994.76	6.399	1
see him go from aggressive duelist over	1998.48	5.319	1
to smoke himself saying the consistency	2001.16	6.0	1
it brings to his play is unreal and	2003.8	4.961	1
looking at how that works if we think	2007.16	3.721	1
about t he's been on agents that can get	2008.76	4.0	1
out of a situation but you know where	2010.88	3.72	1
that Dash goes you know where he might	2012.76	4.72	1
be playing now he can reset on an omen	2014.6	5.679	1
he can he can audio cut and rat a little	2017.48	4.96	1
bit more he has so many more options	2020.28	4.721	1
here and he looks so happy to be playing	2022.44	4.68	1
the new role yeah it's insane too yeah	2025.0	3.679	1
the questions that came out of the t's	2027.12	3.72	1
role of like oh and he's not able to	2028.68	4.561	1
play a raise to on split or he should	2030.84	4.6	1
play a KO because it's it's like his	2033.24	4.12	1
play style from the other games but but	2035.44	4.56	1
this time as an omen he shining his	2037.36	5.799	1
stats this year on average on the yoru	2040.0	6.559	1
The Omen way better than his Jets Kos	2043.16	5.2	1
from last year kind of incredible that	2046.56	3.6	1
he's able to put up these numbers still	2048.36	3.56	1
you see how comfortable he is we're not	2050.16	3.48	1
over yet here three rounds way of	2051.92	3.361	1
getting the first M for SEL as louder	2053.64	3.72	1
looking for the contact play speaking of	2055.28	5.0	1
T he opens up the round Q Falls a tap on	2057.36	5.24	1
the spike Bing out the players of sels	2060.28	6.0	1
trying to push towards the spawn are L	2062.6	5.841	1
they will not any OPP which allows for	2066.28	3.48	1
them to at least get a plant down to	2068.44	4.479	1
build that economy for the	2069.76	3.159	1
next ready with the shorty in the	2073.36	6.76	1
Smoke St by keeps them at B but all of	2076.52	5.839	1
SEL are here getting ready to flood back	2080.12	5.04	1
from that a link once again and there he	2082.36	5.201	1
goes look at that utility everybody's	2085.16	4.081	1
hiding with within the smoke don't for	2087.56	4.0	1
allow sight the sight St off for kills	2089.24	4.879	1
and there's only less Ines left standing	2091.56	5.319	0
and Z himself is cleaning up the sight	2094.12	4.401	1
post offer ready for the next round as	2096.88	4.361	1
Sentinels score the	2098.52	5.8	0
11 it it kind of took Sentinels just	2101.24	6.56	1
fighting back as fast that I think the	2104.32	8.36	1
mid round where we saw Zen fly through	2107.8	7.36	1
that tells you how fast Sentinels want	2112.68	5.159	1
to be going right now and loud are going	2115.16	6.36	1
to be calling the timeout here boom T	2117.84	5.0	1
playing the	2121.52	4.68	1
smokes frags all around for the team is	2122.84	6.201	1
it's not just kind of the 3 utility	2126.2	4.28	1
that's being thrown on a defense for	2129.04	4.92	1
Sentinels they're also alone in these	2130.48	5.28	1
forward positions after they're not	2133.96	3.56	1
really able to set up for trades this	2135.76	2.92	1
time around	2137.52	3.68	1
though looks like loud is just holding	2138.68	5.8	1
back for a mid control	2141.2	3.28	1
MH their wait looks like this zero	2144.88	4.6	1
points going to come over the top you	2148.12	3.72	1
can see zelus is	2149.48	4.76	1
positioning and Loud get two caught in	2151.84	4.041	1
that looked purposeful as well they kind	2154.24	5.119	1
of stood exact where they wanted to so	2155.88	5.8	1
Viper and breach seeing on the right	2159.36	3.72	1
side of the map is what Sentinels is	2161.68	4.48	1
working with right now again this wall	2163.08	4.841	1
only two times since this wall was put	2166.16	3.32	0
up from loud have they tried to work	2167.92	3.919	0
through it last Market we saw Zen came	2169.48	4.72	1
flying through with a showstopper but	2171.84	5.201	1
now they're giving qck quite a task here	2174.2	4.44	1
yeah you already see qck working up the	2177.04	3.0	1
midd of the map the alone comes out	2178.64	3.12	1
toward three the right side but the	2180.04	3.24	1
important thing here is cine taking	2181.76	3.559	1
control of this be link they try to use	2183.28	3.48	1
this Rolling Thunder to hold towards the	2185.32	3.161	1
left side are flash towards the dumpster	2186.76	3.68	1
and instead after it sees nothing on the	2188.48	3.639	1
elbow side they regroup and try to go	2190.44	4.28	1
for the contact	2192.12	6.321	1
play looking at sadok sonar up drone has	2194.72	6.28	1
been used again they're really liking	2198.44	4.8	1
this elbow play at least putting three	2201.0	3.48	1
or four members in there they have to	2203.24	2.76	1
get kenzine in there because the fault	2204.48	3.04	1
lines from that side just seem so much	2206.0	4.2	1
more effective entry the Rolling Thunder	2207.52	5.64	1
yeah to boot right so having kenzen in	2210.2	4.84	1
this elbow has been a priority for loud	2213.16	3.52	1
they set it up again 30 seconds left	2215.04	3.92	1
it's going to be the 5v5 a good lurk	2216.68	4.56	1
here however from tuis could just	2218.96	5.04	0
separate sentinel's rotation feels like	2221.24	6.44	0
loud seeing here that senel like to play	2224.0	5.599	0
the retake just contacting a site	2227.68	4.04	0
allowing this utility to delay even more	2229.6	3.76	1
there it is and as he throws out the	2231.72	4.0	1
Rolling Thunder off the knife Q pushing	2233.36	4.441	1
forward just around the corner though	2235.72	4.76	1
zelus pulls out the N command Z holding	2237.8	4.76	1
all the way back towards That Boba sign	2240.48	3.72	1
where we have a late lurt from TU still	2242.56	3.84	1
waiting for that opportunity to strike	2244.2	4.32	0
back behind them but Sentinels are now	2246.4	4.24	1
running very quickly towards the a site	2248.52	4.0	1
show stopper to open it up it's Planet	2250.64	3.56	1
once again for the elbow spam wingman on	2252.52	3.96	1
the ground cine trying to delay as he	2254.2	4.879	1
runs forward with utility gets sedo on	2256.48	5.52	1
the other side there's that backstab to	2259.08	4.601	1
East trying to go for the hero play	2262.0	3.68	1
there's that first kill it's tapped at	2263.68	5.04	1
half there's no time 10 gets the kill	2265.68	5.639	1
but it's loud that stays alive Tu the	2268.72	6.56	1
ler King on that one absolutely pivotal	2271.32	6.161	1
that Tui stayed alive was able to get a	2275.28	5.64	1
huge kill on John QT there causing that	2277.48	5.2	1
defensive rotation to have to Route	2280.92	3.199	0
Around through spawn take a little bit	2282.68	4.8	0
more time everything that loud did there	2284.12	5.761	0
really hurt Sentinels sen tried to	2287.48	5.32	0
paranoia retake pawn shop into into the	2289.88	5.04	0
the dumpster there and it didn't really	2292.8	4.16	0
hit anybody they tried to retake flash	2294.92	4.32	0
on dumpster and all of what they needed	2296.96	5.159	1
for Sight was already used by the time	2299.24	5.4	1
Sentinels got there loud really draining	2302.12	5.641	1
Sentinels utility in a way they cannot	2304.64	5.199	1
retake see what happens here spread out	2307.76	4.319	1
across the map and a default same wall	2309.84	3.881	0
here loud's just kind of pressuring with	2312.08	4.201	0
this each round to give Sentinels to	2313.72	5.04	0
something uh to look at and then	2316.28	3.64	0
possibly play through it with their	2318.76	3.4	0
flashes saw two sets of footsteps there	2319.92	4.08	1
off that camera from John Q and look at	2322.16	3.88	1
SEL a flash over and a swing after a	2324.0	3.88	1
quad swing coming out and that's just	2326.04	3.559	1
being held back even paranoia to try to	2327.88	3.76	1
move forward C all the way back towards	2329.6	4.76	1
middle instead a spray through the blaze	2331.64	6.88	1
wall to get that kill on the market	2334.36	4.161	1
he's	2339.8	3.6	1
laughing oh that was that was a pretty	2340.6	5.081	1
hot	2343.4	2.28	1
situation as they pull back though with	2345.76	3.92	1
the numbers Advantage five players to	2347.8	4.279	1
work together towards the a site but SEL	2349.68	4.48	1
has the re on	2352.08	5.24	1
this never mind it's a double pump mhm	2354.16	5.28	1
cuz of the position all the way towards	2357.32	5.681	1
the B main okay so I feel like we have	2359.44	5.96	1
been missing this from loud in these few	2363.0	4.4	1
rounds the past round it would be that	2365.4	4.04	1
they tempted be main they were a little	2367.4	4.04	1
bit in mid right qck would flash and	2369.44	4.0	1
then everybody just reset to a default	2371.44	4.84	1
spot to hit a loud have not been leaving	2373.44	4.96	1
breadcrumbs around the map to be able to	2376.28	4.319	1
make audio calls on a rotation or be	2378.4	4.64	0
able to make that rotate and now we're	2380.6	3.881	0
seeing that come into play those	2383.04	4.079	0
audibles we know sadak for in the middle	2384.48	5.72	0
to late round zela he snuck through but	2387.12	5.041	1
KK was still holding towards the	2390.2	4.24	1
billboard of the B main a knife being	2392.16	3.64	1
thrown that would have been huge towards	2394.44	2.879	1
that b Main site where they don't have	2395.8	3.12	1
theault line Aftershock to work with or	2397.32	4.321	1
snake bights as a matter of fact even	2398.92	5.399	1
Q's re flanking towards the mids side	2401.64	4.439	1
but sel's already pushing forward	2404.32	3.52	1
spraying through the attacker smoke	2406.08	3.361	1
snake fight on the ground there's that	2407.84	4.401	1
backstab too good	2409.44	4.43	1
fork	2412.24	5.31	1
[Applause]	2413.87	3.68	1
wow what a swingy game a few rounds here	2417.6	7.041	1
a few rounds there but the the the way	2421.48	5.4	1
the rounds are swinging that team is in	2424.64	4.88	1
full	2426.88	2.64	1
control yeah that was close we see it	2430.68	6.88	1
again hey	2434.76	5.76	1
guy he's like I'm I'm not KO aled right	2437.56	5.12	1
now you can't do that I'm not going to	2440.52	6.16	1
be resed qck with a really nice FL use	2442.68	5.639	1
the alt on pulse plants instead of not	2446.68	3.0	1
having to waste them yes we heard some	2448.32	2.841	1
Hunters Fury but those were trap plays	2449.68	2.88	1
that they had on defense this time	2451.16	3.12	1
around though if they could continue to	2452.56	3.559	1
work the same way I mean for them they	2454.28	3.44	1
don't need to fix anything cuz they're	2456.12	3.641	1
coming back in this game percental the	2457.72	3.52	1
question is how do we want to fight this	2459.76	2.96	1
do we want to move more forward here to	2461.24	4.68	1
not allow L to play the contct it looks	2462.72	4.76	1
for information	2465.92	4.0	1
towards this	2467.48	5.16	1
midside fake TP to be M but the push is	2469.92	4.159	1
huge here from sen they're trying to	2472.64	3.08	1
change the pace of the game of what loud	2474.08	3.52	1
has been seeing the last few rounds	2475.72	4.879	0
feeling in control sen trying to take	2477.6	5.321	1
that away passive play from loud gets	2480.6	4.641	0
them safely across the map here but this	2482.92	4.0	0
is what they were doing before not	2485.24	3.48	1
really tempting or leaving anybody at a	2486.92	4.199	1
sight just making some noise mid and	2488.72	4.76	1
then they're going to hit a this could	2491.12	4.881	1
be basic things too from senel holding	2493.48	3.68	1
towards the back of the site with John's	2496.0	3.359	1
cuy set up on the a just to maybe try to	2497.16	4.64	1
break a windman with his trips inside	2499.36	5.76	1
the a site run it back here utilized by	2501.8	5.44	1
qck just to clear out the space towards	2505.12	5.281	1
the dumpster the plant still comes down	2507.24	6.32	1
a lucky kill up C throws up the hat but	2510.4	7.199	1
the plant still went down for loud	2513.56	6.16	1
that's huge that's Cen Z's the one they	2517.6	3.76	1
want an elbow for him to go down this	2519.72	3.8	1
means that s can get back in right now	2521.36	3.641	0
the goal is to protects to do so that he	2523.52	2.839	1
could use his Hunter's Fury there is	2525.0	3.76	1
that tap uses it out right away and now	2526.36	3.76	1
right after it's going to be allowed to	2528.76	3.12	1
fight back inside the smoke flashes are	2530.12	3.48	0
coming through nades are coming across	2531.88	4.28	0
towards the smokes as ten is holding off	2533.6	5.24	1
angle a curveball a nice Kill from T	2536.16	4.56	1
snake fights underground as well wingman	2538.84	3.76	1
comes up trying to get it down it's at	2540.72	3.96	1
least a halfway he's trying to stick it	2542.6	3.801	1
fully for wingman but gets the nine it's	2544.68	3.879	1
up to a two versus one a push for from	2546.4	5.08	1
blz once again the but John cuy as	2548.56	4.921	1
they'll get to the fuse in that point	2551.48	3.96	1
round 12 for	2553.48	4.96	1
Sentinels Match Point T again I'm pretty	2555.44	5.08	1
sure sidh show mentioned it previously	2558.44	4.399	1
but that flash turning percentage TS	2560.52	4.799	1
being at the top the least flashed	2562.84	5.201	1
member we see it in	2565.32	5.321	1
action and John cue that kill Flash and	2568.04	5.279	1
didn't care Oh still actually got tagged	2570.64	5.679	1
by it never mind good POV good POV it	2573.32	5.391	1
just doesn't matter with	2576.32	3.76	1
[Applause]	2578.71	3.77	1
tens he have a Cowen Zen that kill from	2580.08	4.641	1
John cuy on a Cowen Z you saw how	2582.48	4.119	1
confident Sentinels was to step forward	2584.72	4.96	1
there and go for the hit what a kill to	2586.6	5.681	1
be able to pull up sheris now for the	2589.68	5.2	1
side of loud what a hurt on game point	2592.28	5.279	1
now as they're going to try to get qck	2594.88	4.16	1
up this mid position again a little	2597.56	3.161	1
rinse and repeat on the strats before	2599.04	3.16	1
but it brings most to the team to keep	2600.72	4.16	1
him safe qy K with the sheriff the	2602.2	4.52	1
double swing out the wall Bang forcing	2604.88	4.16	1
zelus away trying to take the mid	2606.72	4.52	1
control even shock darts thrown from	2609.04	4.48	1
sadak to keep him back Sen's trying to	2611.24	3.8	1
push forward it was being watched by	2613.52	3.52	1
last so you have three players now	2615.04	5.16	1
contained in the a site that said though	2617.04	4.6	1
with the amount of rounds that were	2620.2	4.0	1
coming back there for loud that one	2621.64	4.959	1
single loss Now map point for Sentinels	2624.2	5.04	1
the econom is broken for loud have to	2626.6	4.52	1
try to get something done here	2629.24	4.079	1
controlling maybe an orb on the B site a	2631.12	5.641	1
Viper plant off the pit using his all	2633.32	6.24	1
drone to sell that fake with this is we	2636.76	4.76	1
got the back stab though for qk it's	2639.56	3.961	1
perfect but finally John comes out of	2641.52	3.839	1
the camera to trade that out they get	2643.52	3.48	1
information on that Sentinel player	2645.36	3.801	1
towards the back of the site and they	2647.0	5.119	1
try to execute now for	2649.16	6.0	1
Sentinels a tap to allow to swing out	2652.12	5.361	1
instant head shot seconds still not	2655.16	4.199	1
decided to go for the plant for Less	2657.48	3.599	0
they want to use it for cow Z's been a	2659.36	3.561	0
name of the game so far and how they're	2661.08	4.441	0
forming the ARs in the plant SEL now	2662.92	4.52	0
trying to go for a three- player retake	2665.52	3.64	0
at a	2667.44	3.639	1
disadvantage look how far back here	2669.16	3.959	1
sedak is still waiting to see somebody's	2671.08	3.801	1
going to flank across delays being	2673.12	4.361	1
thrown early for alloud a flash towards	2674.88	6.52	1
the market first Contact is less cine	2677.48	7.079	1
avoided the M pit now swings out hit by	2681.4	7.159	1
a least the fragment plant the n a push	2684.56	7.28	1
for it from twois zelis is alone and it	2688.56	6.8	1
becomes a nice pul plan hold for loud	2691.84	4.801	1
that	2695.36	3.521	1
actually is one of the coolest rounds	2696.64	4.64	0
I've seen Sadat come up with when they	2698.88	5.88	0
were running back to a you saw sedak	2701.28	5.0	0
instantly peel off it's like a light	2704.76	4.48	1
bulb went off in his head peels off and	2706.28	4.76	1
then sets up to quickly set the Drone it	2709.24	3.319	1
looked like they were actually running	2711.04	3.799	1
all the way back says okay Tu give me	2712.56	4.961	1
that Al back here they do a global	2714.84	6.081	1
distraction to allow qck K's hit to work	2717.52	7.12	1
even better sick thinking absolutely	2720.92	6.32	1
disgusting and we said just Sheriff just	2724.64	4.04	1
Sheriff it was the two first kills they	2727.24	2.319	1
got	2728.68	4.72	1
honestly Sheri making the crowd ill y	2729.56	7.081	1
making the crowd ill maybe	2733.4	7.56	1
again 9 to 12 pop flash towards mid	2736.64	7.64	1
possibly definitely satchels out from	2740.96	6.04	0
Zin a paranoia on top of that that came	2744.28	4.64	1
from 10 so try to do a trap play with	2747.0	4.079	1
the Lura that they have on the defense	2748.92	4.679	1
for Sentinels but again it's the master	2751.08	5.04	1
class IG and calls from sedak holding	2753.6	4.441	1
all the way back for toward spawn it's	2756.12	5.041	1
wild towards the extremities just wild	2758.04	5.84	1
all right into the side here just three	2761.16	5.919	1
rounds away for loud to secure us r	2763.88	6.239	1
o it's going to be a low buy from sen	2767.08	4.0	1
back in the sight they're going to	2770.12	2.72	1
hunker down and try to find those close	2771.08	5.401	1
angles it's how can loud dislodge them	2772.84	5.561	0
ultimate for Cowen Zen could come around	2776.48	3.599	0
that's the ultimate plant if they can	2778.4	4.36	0
keep cine then elbow without some John	2780.08	6.121	1
CU spam easy one there for zelus oo they	2782.76	4.599	1
lost the breadcrumb that's what they	2786.2	3.32	1
were leaving this time sedak goes down	2787.36	3.801	1
and they have to make noise now this is	2789.52	3.599	1
all going to be heard by T but T only	2791.16	4.04	1
has a sheriff in the back of the aite	2793.12	4.281	0
Sassi with a pistol himself so this is a	2795.2	4.6	0
very weak aite hold a flame coming	2797.4	3.959	0
behind here a flash tens is fully	2799.8	3.16	1
blinded the L comes up from the side	2801.36	5.641	1
from Les yeah s geta ding from Les three	2802.96	5.639	1
players remaining from C is coming back	2807.0	4.28	1
once again from the a link Che now takes	2808.6	4.321	1
control toward the back of the default	2811.28	3.44	1
gets one for his troubles back there a	2812.92	4.0	1
two versus two a pit out a rolling	2814.72	4.119	1
thunder giving a lot of chances for	2816.92	3.6	1
alloud here on the post plant camera	2818.84	4.121	1
coming out forcing now Sentinel to go	2820.52	5.16	1
inside the pit to fight back zelus at	2822.96	4.879	1
low on HP upgraded into a rifle they	2825.68	3.8	1
actually have two rifles to work with	2827.84	3.041	1
there's that first Anni ability to run	2829.48	3.639	1
across zelus does get the pick though	2830.88	4.719	1
and Les has one more s	2833.12	4.761	1
fight by him the tap on his [ __ ] the	2835.6	6.381	1
Kill from celus the F comes out for	2837.88	6.84	1
[Applause]	2841.98	5.74	1
s	2844.72	3.0	1
[Music]	2854.2	22.01	1
n	2874.72	29.92	1
[Music]	2876.21	31.23	1
n	2904.64	5.88	1
3K in one a 4K in the next like the CH	2907.44	4.56	1
like the Caster said at the time they	2910.52	3.48	1
just wanted to end that game it was over	2912.0	4.319	1
and he decided it I am so excited we get	2914.0	3.72	1
them back on split for the rematch	2916.32	3.201	1
though cuz they did test each other they	2917.72	3.72	0
pushed each other to the max Sentinels	2919.52	3.599	0
had things that could take sadak out of	2921.44	4.159	1
vent yada yada we get to see it all in	2923.12	5.0	1
play right now oh qck straight up to	2925.6	5.76	1
vent to start they are quick again no	2928.12	5.081	1
pun intended damn it you're trying	2931.36	3.24	1
you're trying trying to take control now	2933.2	3.56	1
towards the a tower it's a late split	2934.6	4.881	1
for loud as well you see both Les and	2936.76	5.319	1
Cen holding passively towards the a main	2939.48	4.68	1
see no pressure they can once again take	2942.08	4.161	1
control of a heaven and then maintaining	2944.16	3.919	1
a heaven control has been in of the game	2946.24	5.359	1
on this very map in this meta still a	2948.08	4.76	1
player holding towards the back of the	2951.6	3.361	1
site though zelus is hiding behind the	2952.84	4.361	1
map through two cages through a orb as	2954.96	4.04	1
think by gives his position away trying	2957.2	4.599	1
to look for a trap through this trip but	2959.0	4.799	1
it's cadine that breaks it runs through	2961.8	4.401	1
and scores first a one for one though as	2963.8	5.681	1
TZ is low on HP Spike finally going down	2966.2	5.919	1
asasi is on that flank on the a main Les	2969.48	4.639	1
has fallen so the control on the a	2972.12	3.72	1
heaven is going to be a little bit more	2974.12	4.521	1
difficult especially when two Falls	2975.84	4.401	0
giving an opportunity for senel to	2978.64	5.199	0
bombard utility NS and a flash trades	2980.24	6.359	1
off towards the back F line not able to	2983.84	5.72	1
come out as T swings from the elbow and	2986.6	5.2	1
Sentinels win a pistol Sentinels take	2989.56	4.481	1
the pistol a lot going on in that round	2991.8	4.481	1
loud very confident in their movement	2994.04	4.039	1
nice find to be able to get all the way	2996.28	4.0	1
through V towards a a heaven and	2998.08	4.441	1
waterfall in and then comes again the	3000.28	5.24	1
sen retake they gather together able to	3002.52	5.44	0
take out the sides extremities and	3005.52	4.16	0
basically everybody meets towards the	3007.96	3.119	0
top side of site for that flash from	3009.68	3.24	0
sashy to come in two from heav one	3011.08	5.121	0
screen but they are patient on that	3012.92	5.439	0
retake and a big play there as well	3016.2	4.48	0
Insight from zelus to be able to even	3018.36	4.561	0
deny those few seconds allow the B	3020.68	5.0	0
rotation to be a little bit closer so	3022.92	4.52	0
they are in position there it took them	3025.68	5.32	1
a bit to get zalis out of the site four	3027.44	6.76	1
or 14 here loud will slow work their	3031.0	5.28	1
wall up here towards the vent area I	3034.2	5.08	1
believe sashy says not so quick a six	3036.28	5.799	1
sense gets the pick that's a sky down	3039.28	4.44	1
for the attack but fall line pushes him	3042.08	4.161	1
away Les meanwhile did get an entry to	3043.72	4.879	1
trade it back towards the top of heaven	3046.24	4.24	1
so sash's in a tou spot but he's been	3048.6	4.321	1
good in this very spot before trying to	3050.48	4.44	1
isolate a 1 V one as Ken and his	3052.92	4.679	0
teammate push is in double shot and even	3054.92	4.12	1
a	3057.6	5.801	1
145 oh the sake fight good shots coming	3059.04	6.36	1
now but the utility is even better for	3063.4	4.76	0
SEL to answer right back that Spike down	3065.4	5.24	1
out in the open one versus three but	3068.16	5.199	1
tuis does have a sheriff zelus is low	3070.64	6.32	1
zekin is low this is duall sunset Deja	3073.36	7.24	1
Vu with that nade oh my word and really	3076.96	5.639	1
nicely done cuz I'm I'm sure John cue	3080.6	4.321	1
said someone is destroying my trips in B	3082.6	4.76	1
let's just hit whoever is in sight so	3084.92	5.159	1
those mollies and grenades a very high	3087.36	4.281	1
chance to be hitting their target and	3090.08	4.881	1
that they did but what can tuis do here	3091.64	5.64	1
two one shots and he has to connect with	3094.96	5.399	1
John cutie twice if it's not the head he	3097.28	5.16	1
had a lot of time to work a minute on	3100.36	3.641	1
the clock before he made it towards the	3102.44	3.0	1
line of scrimmage of the aite but a	3104.0	3.76	1
camera refresh for John cutie allowing	3105.44	3.84	1
for them to get ready for a triple swing	3107.76	3.76	1
on a contact Tu still looking to move	3109.28	4.319	1
forward 18 seconds left on the clock	3111.52	3.36	1
there's that contact there's oneon-one	3113.6	3.52	1
end y but was not ready for a second on	3114.88	4.719	1
the top of Heaven you see what these	3117.12	5.041	1
rounds mean though while there was the	3119.6	5.321	1
win there John we even wanted to wanted	3122.16	5.6	1
to drop those weapons and the win would	3124.92	4.879	1
have been the Big W S not letting it	3127.76	3.76	1
happen again though able to pick up that	3129.8	3.881	1
round still losing a few members though	3131.52	5.2	1
so not too bad loud still do some chip	3133.68	4.919	1
damage to that	3136.72	5.079	0
economy and now we'll see full Vandal bu	3138.6	5.321	0
across the board for them if they can	3141.8	4.641	0
start to take this	3143.92	4.6	1
wanting more saying just give me a few	3146.44	4.76	1
more few more they know they need it	3148.52	5.279	1
here again	3151.2	2.599	1
Sentinels which is surprising too that	3153.96	4.639	1
loud decid to pick the attack site first	3156.0	5.0	1
sel's very strong defensive halfs on	3158.6	5.441	1
this map screen down so now they have to	3161.0	4.76	1
try to work something getting a plant	3164.04	2.799	1
maybe would have helped them a little	3165.76	2.839	1
bit more in further rounds but at least	3166.84	3.48	1
they still have a gun round now third	3168.6	4.52	1
round on the board for split but T long	3170.32	6.161	1
range with a stinger Lees beams	3173.12	6.641	1
qck wow allows SEL to get the power play	3176.48	4.8	1
that was like oh there're still going to	3179.76	2.96	1
be I was going to say that's a trap play	3181.28	3.24	1
to Mid but it really only needed the the	3182.72	4.28	1
smoke to drop in tends to be there they	3184.52	4.319	1
were all ready to back him up though if	3187.0	4.319	1
it need be now the rotation back to a	3188.84	4.361	1
bit of a 3-2 yeah that's something that	3191.32	5.641	1
probably Bren would say they are T they	3193.2	6.599	1
are and they do I mean just pushing out	3196.96	4.159	1
with a stinger as well knowing you're	3199.8	3.681	1
going against the full by round didn't	3201.12	3.841	1
even phase him knows he can hit that	3203.48	3.24	1
head shot get the aim punch and finish	3204.96	4.92	1
it as it were paranoia still there if	3206.72	5.399	1
they want to play the retake more so and	3209.88	3.8	0
they are going to find a being a little	3212.12	3.361	1
Troublesome here as loud takes the sight	3213.68	3.879	1
he misses snake B so sasi has to fight	3215.48	4.16	1
alone fin L swings out doesn't care	3217.56	3.56	1
about being vulnerable that's a one for	3219.64	3.88	0
one but the advantage is still for sels	3221.12	4.24	1
less and twoes they've done this before	3223.52	4.0	0
at a disadvantage the first one to fall	3225.36	5.801	1
is sash almost gets that tap at one HP	3227.52	5.96	0
pain shells once again is it a touchdown	3231.16	4.159	1
but T doesn't care swings in for the the	3233.48	4.48	1
kills with the Stinger first and last	3235.32	5.681	1
two kills of this round asals win the	3237.96	6.2	1
bonus man T picking up you're not even	3241.0	4.359	1
you're not even going to say oh he's for	3244.16	3.48	1
the ultimate no tens is just heating up	3245.36	3.801	1
that's as good as having an ultimate all	3247.64	4.4	1
the time and he is cleaning up with that	3249.16	5.12	1
Stinger opening kill on the round final	3252.04	5.36	1
two kills on the round tens is let loose	3254.28	6.64	1
right now alow by again for loud here	3257.4	6.76	1
and they have not had a good time once	3260.92	5.24	1
they get to the site van silly it seems	3264.16	4.76	1
like loud needs to figure out a way	3266.16	5.04	1
again to start chip damaging Sentinels	3268.92	4.24	1
before they get to the site get this	3271.2	3.32	1
utility out of their hands cuz the	3273.16	4.28	1
retake is just too strong okay ramp	3274.52	6.96	1
control here for loud's try and pressure	3277.44	5.8	1
try and get Sentinels to move dislodge	3281.48	3.8	1
them from the original starting spots	3283.24	4.4	1
and coming up from the vent could get a	3285.28	5.0	1
kill here on to zelis her the drops as	3287.64	4.439	1
zelus goes back up there's a smoke for	3290.28	3.64	1
him to hide behind the Viper wall makes	3292.08	3.52	1
that out of safety so the time out but	3293.92	4.32	1
at least a stinger through two smokes	3295.6	5.48	1
puts zelus	3298.24	6.68	0
down that's crazy Vance Sentinels oh	3301.08	5.681	0
nice shot in the 10 yeah that's crazy	3304.92	4.8	0
Sentinels are losing players with a buy	3306.76	5.76	0
here from loud a lower buy that they	3309.72	4.359	0
have finally the anchor towards the back	3312.52	3.839	1
of the site swings for two sad looking	3314.08	5.52	1
to trade it out Q was	3316.36	6.281	0
there 2 looking for a timing made it	3319.6	4.401	0
through	3322.64	5.76	1
but C Falls a 2v2 40 seconds left on the	3324.0	6.319	1
clock spike is still up so they actually	3328.4	3.719	1
manage to take it back and move forward	3330.32	3.201	1
but John	3332.12	5.081	1
CU not loud to leave anywhere else as	3333.52	6.68	1
Rob Moore would say this kid can frag	3337.2	6.08	1
holy moly and he does calling the shots	3340.2	6.0	1
fragging the shots as well and the	3343.28	4.12	1
interesting thing I wanted to mention	3346.2	3.839	1
about that round Sentinels used that	3347.4	5.159	1
exact strategy to kill sadak when he had	3350.04	4.481	1
a judge and vent the last time they	3352.56	4.24	1
played so loud's like oh this Strat	3354.52	4.799	1
let's do it four up ramp one through mid	3356.8	5.28	1
zelis gets out and Sentinels still find	3359.32	4.121	1
a way to come up with the round even	3362.08	3.0	1
with a cheeky little trap play there	3363.44	3.879	1
from	3365.08	2.24	1
loud all	3369.32	5.52	1
right loud has been collecting these	3372.16	5.08	1
timeouts once they have this Rolling	3374.84	4.681	1
Thunder a bit a few ultimates to use	3377.24	3.799	1
here full ball for	3379.52	3.799	1
Sentinels yeah looking how things starts	3381.04	3.921	1
off though when we look at this rolling	3383.32	3.361	1
Thunder they not really trying to set	3384.96	3.76	1
something quick even spike is dropped	3386.68	3.399	1
trying to avoid flashes at the beginning	3388.72	2.16	1
of the	3390.08	3.121	1
round Wall comes up on the attack	3390.88	3.919	1
there's no answer for Sentinel so for	3393.2	3.32	1
Sentinel are they're staying quiet on	3394.8	3.56	1
their positions of where they're trying	3396.52	3.92	1
to hold the a site yeah they have	3398.36	3.841	1
options right they're keeping kawen in a	3400.44	3.639	1
nice fault line position they can go for	3402.2	4.119	1
ramp if they need to in a bit or they	3404.08	3.72	0
can go for something else we see that	3406.32	3.28	0
fault line coming back off a cool down	3407.8	3.961	0
so it wasn't an initial push from	3409.6	4.801	0
Sentinels giving safety here to both	3411.76	4.039	0
sadak and	3414.4	4.32	0
less so that's one Guiding Light one	3415.8	4.921	0
Trailblazer now used over towards the	3418.72	3.44	1
right side of this map I think this	3420.72	3.399	0
might activate your BS side a little	3422.16	3.12	0
start to walk	3424.12	3.841	0
in they get the cam and they press on on	3425.28	4.759	0
both ends so they actually didn't even	3427.96	4.079	0
break the cam yet for loud but it did	3430.04	3.361	0
smoke and actually the Trailblazer came	3432.04	3.0	1
up and that's actually quite crazy cuz	3433.4	3.12	0
not only the camera didn't break the	3435.04	3.241	0
Trailblazer did not break the trip but	3436.52	3.64	1
it got pinged out here by sedak as he	3438.28	3.759	0
dogged up so loud's going to have to be	3440.16	3.199	1
ready once to start hitting a sight if	3442.04	2.56	1
they want to split towards the a site	3443.36	3.041	1
through this Rolling Thunder just get	3444.6	3.76	1
ready so you can break this trip and not	3446.4	4.08	1
get sprayed by Z's position howder	3448.36	3.72	1
really trying to get the Seekers out	3450.48	4.8	1
right now in Sai is not given it here we	3452.08	4.401	1
go for the Rolling Thunder into the	3455.28	2.48	1
sight it's going to still be the retake	3456.48	2.0	1
from	3457.76	3.279	1
s The Flash in The Seekers does not	3458.48	5.48	1
allowed to get Q's kill on S but swings	3461.04	5.04	1
out still for that one second on the top	3463.96	4.44	1
of the a Heavens to drop two of his own	3466.08	3.881	1
spite let to get picked up once again	3468.4	4.56	1
nice shot by second to Second turning it	3469.96	4.96	1
around back in favor of loud and it's	3472.96	4.44	1
only zelus by himself first Contact	3474.92	4.56	1
against qck and there's that second	3477.4	4.24	1
swing from tuis not hunting down towards	3479.48	5.04	1
the side but loud defly instead of	3481.64	4.52	1
playing protocols just won the fight	3484.52	4.76	1
fight fight they had to at that point I	3486.16	5.76	1
mean as the clock runs down you don't	3489.28	4.559	1
get much more room to work you're going	3491.92	3.52	1
to have to go and you're going to have	3493.84	4.121	1
to accept that Seekers will find that	3495.44	6.159	1
out great push through flashed and	3497.96	6.52	1
denied by Seekers loud still getting the	3501.6	5.48	1
ground they need and are finally able to	3504.48	5.2	1
push forward out of the sight not allow	3507.08	4.28	1
send that setup that they've been	3509.68	4.48	1
getting unfortunate	3511.36	5.801	1
unfortunate four to one now loud feeling	3514.16	4.919	1
good though very fortunate for them	3517.16	4.32	1
ultimate for qck just one away here if	3519.08	4.76	1
they can focus an orb	3521.48	4.48	1
and definitely a light at the end of the	3523.84	4.121	1
tunnel to start grabbing more rounds	3525.96	4.56	1
obviously a buy here for Sen they had	3527.96	3.92	1
quite a bit of money to go through with	3530.52	3.4	1
those first four rounds this is a	3531.88	4.719	1
default we see go to a lot so set up in	3533.92	5.72	1
this 221 qck will now push up towards	3536.6	5.161	1
the vent sadok behind but they don't	3539.64	4.56	1
have time what a read here by Sentinels	3541.76	4.319	1
showstopper does not get any kills yet	3544.2	4.159	1
though you saw the idea out from loud	3546.08	3.52	1
but we hold that thought for a bit	3548.36	3.96	1
paranoia for allow to try to re-engage	3549.6	4.921	1
for control inside garage and finally as	3552.32	3.361	1
it slows down you could see it the	3554.52	3.0	0
trailer came out from sedak and he just	3555.68	3.919	0
waited at the corner with this dog up	3557.52	3.839	1
towards middle hoping to bait the show	3559.6	3.921	1
stoer out towards middle but then S	3561.36	2.841	1
okayy no we're going to take the	3563.52	2.64	1
extremity said and almost caught her few	3564.2	4.2	0
off that show	3566.16	4.6	1
stopper everybody trying to flip the	3568.4	5.439	1
timing right now sadak oh my gosh oh	3570.76	5.44	1
he's being watched three players are	3573.84	3.841	1
looking back they knew the orb was	3576.2	3.48	1
coming down sadak finally spotted and	3577.68	4.879	1
he's in heavy trouble yeah easy diggings	3579.68	5.52	1
here for Z as shooting anry towards the	3582.56	5.121	0
back of the site cage coming up get the	3585.2	3.56	0
hat	3587.68	3.679	0
out beat bossing around the map here as	3588.76	4.079	0
the rest of his team is able to clean it	3591.36	4.321	1
up from behind just Cypher walk around	3592.84	5.321	0
there trying to find his hat trying to	3595.68	5.32	0
find a body but he just could not he	3598.16	4.879	0
just couldn't find that no all right 5	3601.0	5.079	0
to one as we come up onto round seven Z	3603.04	6.241	0
92 and one I feel like there has been a	3606.08	5.121	0
lot of showstoppers out of Z in just	3609.28	4.839	0
this series pressuring it that one from	3611.2	5.52	0
loud really well absorbed understanding	3614.12	5.48	1
that would go into mid or or from B main	3616.72	5.0	1
they could rotate back around to Mid but	3619.6	4.161	1
Sentinels just seem to have the read	3621.72	4.8	1
after the initial again Z's been a	3623.76	4.079	1
nuisance towards the top of that a	3626.52	4.48	1
heaven side and Loud can't seem to	3627.84	5.28	1
really push him away from that spot and	3631.0	3.52	1
as they try to go for control towards	3633.12	3.761	1
the aamp this time a slight change of	3634.52	4.039	1
pace TS trying to play that aggressive	3636.88	3.439	1
position up towards the aamp doesn't	3638.56	4.361	1
even care about the satchels andus balls	3640.32	4.76	1
as	3642.92	2.159	1
well so you see sometimes it's	3645.28	3.64	0
aggressive from loud sometimes it's slow	3647.4	3.24	0
on the a ramp and even the positioning	3648.92	3.439	0
is well read from how Sentinels want to	3650.64	5.439	1
play seconds uh T and Z known for	3652.36	8.2	1
anchoring quite well on that a heaven	3656.08	4.48	1
side cover going now already loud	3660.8	5.52	1
working numbers down here Sentinels is	3664.0	5.24	1
not making anything easy for loud I	3666.32	5.681	1
think this is what we see from sen right	3669.24	5.599	0
if we had tens on bind they'd be pushing	3672.0	5.24	0
extremities everywhere the sen comp for	3674.84	4.801	0
split means they stay back they crowd	3677.24	4.76	0
together they retake together being able	3679.64	4.439	0
to flip Styles and identities like that	3682.0	5.28	1
I think Mak Sentinels so strong and hard	3684.08	4.96	1
for teams to read that aggression oh the	3687.28	6.4	1
trip across too easy down a saw the idea	3689.04	7.241	0
there and that L ler 30 seconds left not	3693.68	3.879	1
going to do too	3696.28	3.72	1
much okay at least that kill onto John	3697.56	5.121	1
cuy winning that fight rare moment there	3700.0	5.119	1
for the IG of Sentinel sign you	3702.68	5.52	1
definitely see here with 18 seconds	3705.12	5.841	1
left Phantom in	3708.2	5.28	1
hand just going to try to save it but	3710.96	4.28	1
the idea for loud was trying to go for	3713.48	4.76	0
just basic utility hit that aite the one	3715.24	4.96	0
pesky trip not breaking that utility	3718.24	4.319	0
from the John cue side on that a site	3720.2	5.52	1
allowing the anchor player of s so good	3722.56	6.121	1
back of sight flower pots yeah hell like	3725.72	4.839	1
he's so good uh in all of these rounds	3728.68	4.639	1
that we've seen Cal play their defensive	3730.56	4.8	1
side on split so far if we think back	3733.32	4.081	1
just to the the round Zack blasted into	3735.36	4.72	1
B main we were almost about to talk to	3737.4	4.84	1
about loud setting up their default	3740.08	4.0	1
again right partially through the round	3742.24	4.64	1
loud want to set up a default it's kind	3744.08	4.841	1
of telling to just look at that scenario	3746.88	4.52	1
and say Sentinels doesn't want loud to	3748.92	4.48	1
do default anything they're not giving	3751.4	4.24	1
loud time to default anything or get the	3753.4	4.919	1
benefit of defaulting anything they are	3755.64	5.159	1
really messing with how loud approaches	3758.32	4.76	0
the game here one of them is just	3760.8	4.161	1
staying back staying safe and making the	3763.08	4.161	1
retake that much stronger so loud try to	3764.96	4.159	1
put the game in their hands one of our	3767.24	4.599	0
first fast blast packs up here that was	3769.12	5.0	0
facilitated by Cen Zen's breach fault	3771.84	3.121	0
line	3774.12	2.881	1
staying alert staying safe and this time	3774.96	4.319	1
swing towards heaven even though you had	3777.0	4.64	1
the same type of conditioning that it's	3779.28	4.401	1
Zing out there outside that window of	3781.64	3.88	1
the aide this time it was 10 trying to	3783.68	3.2	1
hold it out but you saw the Crosshair	3785.52	3.599	1
placement from louds side instant entry	3786.88	5.239	1
and Advantage for the	3789.12	3.0	1
attack slow play denial delay right now	3792.84	6.801	1
coming in just so loud can't complete	3796.88	4.679	1
the strategy they want but they're also	3799.64	3.439	1
happy to see some of this util from	3801.56	3.841	1
Sentinels let in the power that they're	3803.08	3.881	1
going to have to deal with as they enter	3805.4	3.399	1
a site looks like it might be a commit	3806.96	4.839	1
to B no okay we see start trolling down	3808.8	5.28	1
the sewers and the rotation back	3811.8	4.601	1
overx they're definitely gambling this	3814.08	5.121	1
rotate back towards that b side Seekers	3816.4	4.52	1
coming out just to keep those players	3819.2	4.04	1
anchored inside be that's going to make	3820.92	4.439	1
it difficult for zelus couldn't find any	3823.24	4.319	0
surprise kills no trap coming across on	3825.36	3.401	1
his bside	3827.56	3.24	1
hold he going to say potentially they're	3828.76	3.359	1
going to try to save their weapons here	3830.8	3.52	1
but look at that rotate back from senal	3832.12	4.48	1
7 seconds left and zelus is trying to	3834.32	3.881	1
find a	3836.6	4.24	1
timing screen down this is it they crowd	3838.2	4.159	1
together all the power in one spot from	3840.84	2.72	1
screens they still have a dog and a	3842.36	2.361	1
flash so that's going to help them get	3843.56	3.56	1
information already preemptive utility	3844.72	5.559	1
used by loud for the P PL there is the O	3847.12	5.0	1
coming through forcing the dog to fall	3850.28	3.76	1
back there's that flash to swing out and	3852.12	3.561	1
Q gets the first pick that's definitely	3854.04	2.8	1
going to be for the	3855.68	3.8	1
last it's kind of like you first never	3856.84	5.641	1
mind we don't want any of that	3859.48	6.0	1
loud what a quick round by them but	3862.48	4.96	1
let's look at how they took it it is one	3865.48	4.639	1
of theirs a spray from Les that opens up	3867.44	4.96	1
that's a 5v4 that's legit another spray	3870.12	3.761	1
coming through the smoke isn't something	3872.4	3.84	1
you can replicate but the speed loud	3873.88	4.64	1
took on that round is what kind of gets	3876.24	5.2	1
Sentinels off kilter there loud can do	3878.52	5.0	1
that again so definitely seeing that	3881.44	4.52	1
speed is playing to their favor qck is	3883.52	4.559	1
going to have ultimate after this so off	3885.96	4.0	1
the rip we might get it again from loud	3888.08	3.72	1
and I think that's the way they should	3889.96	4.04	1
go and I I love that slight adjustment	3891.8	2.961	1
from	3894.0	3.079	1
a simple just push towards that window	3894.76	3.839	1
because when you're looking at where the	3897.08	3.601	1
anchor player towards the a side usually	3898.6	4.161	1
s is just waiting towards the back of	3900.68	3.48	1
the map playing behind the trip so you	3902.76	3.519	1
don't really have too much presence on	3904.16	3.959	1
screens or elbows so they just want to	3906.28	3.161	1
gamble it there when the Wall comes down	3908.12	2.761	1
for loud to get the pick and the gamble	3909.44	4.0	1
pays off of course Sentinels are you	3910.88	4.439	1
going to try to readjust on this and it	3913.44	3.48	1
starts off early I mean sashi's already	3915.32	3.24	1
at the entrance here looking to	3916.92	3.32	1
potentially flash for	3918.56	4.201	1
info as a knock comes out for the first	3920.24	4.16	1
time too and we talked about that that	3922.76	3.359	1
line of sight right and look at T	3924.4	3.28	1
instead of being towards the a heav he's	3926.12	3.641	1
oping out down the straight line from	3927.68	5.919	1
screens towards the entrance of that a	3929.76	3.839	1
sight there's a check making sure the	3934.76	3.96	1
Viper wall that just went up and down	3937.12	4.16	1
from Les did not provide any	3938.72	5.96	1
movement a 131 a lot of options for loud	3941.28	5.0	1
here they can actually call any audible	3944.68	3.919	1
they want a very flowing Strat to go	3946.28	5.161	1
through vent or B main here or uh male	3948.6	5.24	1
rather and male has a lot of utility	3951.44	3.839	1
look at get that show ster out for	3953.84	5.72	1
control Den run away gets two	3955.28	7.241	1
what it was like from the grave is	3959.56	6.04	1
insane what one straight bullet probably	3962.52	5.039	1
before he fell down seriously boom	3965.6	3.921	1
that's two down and already the pit out	3967.56	4.441	1
on the defense Doo loud is still trying	3969.52	4.599	1
to commit into this spike is still up on	3972.0	3.279	1
the back of	3974.12	3.761	0
sedak zel is holding behind here the	3975.28	5.121	0
double box trying to wrap around waiting	3977.88	5.399	1
for the tap of the spike fre players	3980.4	5.399	1
just trying to clear out the pit and it	3983.28	4.721	1
never checked that corner so everybody's	3985.8	3.48	1
dling down on	3988.0	3.839	1
HP now the plant comes down zela still	3989.28	4.881	1
holds it giving a chance here for SEL to	3991.84	4.401	0
across even the hat comes out there's	3994.16	4.04	0
that kill from zelus they spot the last	3996.24	3.52	1
two players the lurk is not even going	3998.2	4.24	0
to working last one now pinged out two	3999.76	4.64	0
East on the top of B Heaven The Flash	4002.44	4.679	1
the swing the diffuse is started and the	4004.4	6.199	1
kill comes in for John cutie 7 to2 a	4007.12	5.96	1
round you can chalk up to New Jersey	4010.6	6.161	1
finest oh oh what a double kill from	4013.08	7.601	1
Heaven Z season has been unreal right	4016.76	5.88	1
now they talked about him on the desk in	4020.68	4.399	1
between game one and two he has been	4022.64	5.159	1
putting off numbers but also you put him	4025.08	4.361	1
in situations where you should see a	4027.8	3.601	1
player going down with no kills he'll	4029.44	5.0	1
come up with too he'll come up with the	4031.4	7.52	1
unreal play and it's just wearing away	4034.44	6.599	1
loud that they can't get past this kind	4038.92	4.08	1
of stuff right now flick of the day	4041.04	3.76	1
flick of the day	4043.0	3.279	1
you bring it back for something like	4044.8	3.841	1
that honestly operator still there	4046.28	4.56	1
Sentinels feeling very much in control	4048.64	4.959	0
of this game receiving each one of loud	4050.84	5.401	0
strats so far so what is next tuis gets	4053.6	5.2	0
the op we got double Omen operator on	4056.24	4.839	0
the map right now less with the alt if	4058.8	4.76	0
they can gain ground into a sight and	4061.08	4.641	1
maybe even try to flex with it to put it	4063.56	5.04	1
down first that's rare too usually it's	4065.72	5.119	1
used on the defensive side for Q and	4068.6	5.881	1
twois makes that work though once again	4070.84	6.361	1
a high gamble that pays off for a power	4074.48	4.839	1
play for loud but they still have to go	4077.2	4.72	1
some through some yeah heavy heavy fire	4079.32	4.641	1
power of Sentinels here but Tes alone	4081.92	3.84	1
towards the Gite only has that op to	4083.96	3.8	1
work with a push down from zela so we're	4085.76	4.16	1
trying to go for again those one and	4087.76	5.2	1
duns hoping to get two hoping to get	4089.92	5.439	1
information as	4092.96	6.0	1
well I think he gets a mid lurk they go	4095.36	6.0	1
all the way around sloud is being very	4098.96	4.16	1
safe here I think zel's just turned so	4101.36	3.0	1
he might have heard him	4103.12	4.36	1
cross got that little step if they make	4104.36	5.0	0
any noise on ramp well no there you go	4107.48	4.56	0
allows T to inch out a little bit more	4109.36	4.96	0
get that pick Z to join him towards the	4112.04	4.44	1
back of the site there's a second and	4114.32	4.561	1
he's been good in this position as well	4116.48	4.08	1
parano on both ends not allowing the	4118.88	3.76	1
push forward a TP backwards as	4120.56	5.159	1
well but then finally kuki andless comes	4122.64	7.559	1
in they traded out two versus two zelus	4125.72	6.08	1
too far to throw the sake bites down to	4130.2	4.201	1
deny the plant John	4131.8	5.121	1
to meet up with as yes Les gets the AL	4134.4	4.68	1
out contr the elbow and both moving	4136.92	4.0	1
towards the screen that's a wild amount	4139.08	3.639	0
of ultimate right there pushed out a bit	4140.92	3.759	0
because of the column giving them much	4142.72	3.721	0
more room to play with	4144.68	4.441	0
here what all what do they have two they	4146.44	4.399	0
could viper bite elbow and try to make	4149.12	3.599	0
their way in watching just the entrance	4150.84	3.721	0
to sight from the uh top side here but	4152.72	3.841	0
that boom bot gives a clue here oh that	4154.56	3.639	0
players are coming across the wall bang	4156.56	4.0	0
after but the second one is nowhere to	4158.2	3.761	1
just sticking the spike right now and	4160.56	4.4	1
zelis will get	4161.96	5.719	1
theuse at the beginning of this map we	4164.96	6.16	1
said Sentinels somehow gets these	4167.68	6.721	0
Insight sticks on the defuse they take	4171.12	5.36	1
the site with members of the opposing	4174.4	4.439	1
team still alive to force them out of	4176.48	4.48	1
their position where they feel safe that	4178.84	5.36	1
was out of the ultimate and I think loud	4180.96	5.04	1
also predicted they might find some	4184.2	4.281	1
utility at elbow both Swing Out middle	4186.0	5.799	1
sight and that's all they wrot Sentinels	4188.48	5.679	1
stick to defuse again it's coming all	4191.8	5.801	1
too common and they get the round 8 to2	4194.16	6.56	1
now for Sentinels it's not the same	4197.6	5.4	1
comeback that Sunset had for loud that's	4200.72	4.081	1
for sure I feel that there's a moment of	4203.0	4.76	1
pressure there for L to on a 2v2 ouch	4204.8	6.08	0
hold though it's a beautiful fall once	4207.76	6.6	1
again using that theault line is	4210.88	6.08	1
Cosmetics two Falls for this heavy	4214.36	3.839	0
pressure that Lou is trying to get	4216.96	3.68	0
towards middle SEL are crunching back in	4218.2	4.561	1
looking to fight back sadak is stuck	4220.64	3.92	1
behind the boxes Satchel coming out	4222.76	5.12	1
celus with a jump kill doesn't care	4224.56	6.24	1
twerks away Sentinels is not allowing	4227.88	4.88	1
loud to play the game right now	4230.8	4.12	1
continuously pushing up finding their	4232.76	4.68	1
own fights pushing loud out of their own	4234.92	5.239	1
strategies constantly here to reset try	4237.44	5.759	1
again less mechanically gifted ready to	4240.16	5.0	1
open up on any members that Peak but	4243.2	4.601	0
Sentinels stay hunkered down trading	4245.16	4.401	1
each other ready on these hard angles	4247.8	3.6	1
look even all the way out of a at this	4249.56	3.639	0
point usually you have members anchored	4251.4	4.4	0
in sight but they're not giving loud any	4253.2	4.321	0
opportunities exactly they got active	4255.8	3.04	0
information the camera is watching	4257.52	2.8	1
everything from a and also towards	4258.84	2.76	1
heaven they just flash towards the	4260.32	4.04	1
garage as well coming out from Sashi so	4261.6	5.079	1
now the only the only positions that	4264.36	5.56	1
they could think of is 30 seconds V or	4266.68	5.04	1
rotate back towards a main holding	4269.92	3.759	1
outside of the radius of that camera	4271.72	3.48	1
it's not going to be easy for allow to	4273.68	3.601	1
take position so you already see it	4275.2	3.48	1
still anchoring up now towards the	4277.28	3.6	1
middle yeah this give up this round yeah	4278.68	3.921	1
save for sure knowing the ultimates are	4280.88	3.799	1
there Zin could easily just pop in seems	4282.6	5.119	0
like he has alts on rerun right now just	4284.68	5.121	0
more in his pocket once he uses	4287.72	4.96	0
it and go which and which sorry gives me	4289.8	4.12	0
an opportunity to talk a little bit	4292.68	2.801	0
about that pressure I was talking about	4293.92	3.92	0
and falling on those slight mistakes it	4295.48	4.8	0
was a 2v2 where they boom on outside of	4297.84	4.44	1
their own pit to give their positions	4300.28	3.76	1
away and that's something that they're	4302.28	2.959	1
going to have to clean up here if they	4304.04	3.119	1
want to play against a Sentinels that	4305.24	5.0	1
look so polished this kickoff in this	4307.16	7.681	0
year in this season of the BCT Americas	4310.24	7.121	1
I don't think we've really I we've seen	4314.84	4.48	1
it before but it's uncommon to see a	4317.36	3.68	1
team be able to play to their win	4319.32	3.56	1
condition so much and not have it	4321.04	4.08	1
affected really at all by their opponent	4322.88	3.96	1
if they're able to to switch something	4325.12	4.32	1
so slightly and it it keeps the flow	4326.84	5.0	1
going look at that that's Mance man	4329.44	5.08	1
getting a head scratch right there it's	4331.84	5.92	1
a cute cat all right there's some L for	4334.52	5.08	0
you as we get back into the game final	4337.76	3.64	0
round here can loud pick up a third one	4339.6	5.4	0
and save off a quick two rounds or three	4341.4	6.52	0
if sen can grab pistol the second half	4345.0	5.679	0
explod exactly a rare Fallout explosion	4347.92	3.799	0
towards the	4350.68	3.641	1
P senel just holding back using the	4351.72	4.52	1
camera looking to pressure up trap	4354.32	4.56	0
towards the male instead plant coming	4356.24	4.121	1
down for B	4358.88	5.6	1
main Seekers out as well instant retake	4360.36	6.68	1
attempt qck surprises one but second	4364.48	4.92	1
comes out with the CH stopper following	4367.04	5.119	1
The Seekers gets the N Les is out	4369.4	4.56	1
towards the pillar gets a pick look at	4372.16	3.841	1
that TP for the FL from as well things	4373.96	3.88	1
are looking good here for alloud on the	4376.0	3.88	1
post plant a high L stack now towards	4377.84	3.64	1
the dumpster paranoia and Flash coming	4379.88	3.24	1
through the high low is good for that	4381.48	3.44	1
first pick T looking to trade it back	4383.12	3.84	1
looking left and right through the the	4384.92	5.6	0
Viper or to get the pick but John cuy	4386.96	5.719	0
now in a clutch situation remember that	4390.52	4.44	1
TP I talked about before not even need	4392.68	4.841	1
it this time around cine winning his 1	4394.96	4.88	1
V1 allowing the half to finish N9 to	4397.52	5.04	1
three they finally get that third round	4399.84	6.28	1
and it again it is a huge one Sentinels	4402.56	7.159	1
had the read the whole time it took loud	4406.12	5.96	1
everything they had and the tank to get	4409.72	5.281	1
these rounds to hold the sight to get	4412.08	4.159	1
themselves the victory there and we	4415.0	3.04	1
could see just in the final rounds how	4416.24	4.721	1
Sentinels would make loud work for it	4418.04	5.92	1
over and over we're not seeing loud dive	4420.96	5.32	1
in off the back of qck and Sentinels	4423.96	4.92	1
know that qk isn't getting minivan so	4426.28	4.28	1
that I could see him play just like Z	4428.88	3.64	1
now but absolutely speaking of him 12	4430.56	4.4	1
and six so far the spray transfer that	4432.52	4.639	1
we saw that was sick on that first half	4434.96	3.6	1
when they were playing against the show	4437.16	4.241	1
stopper of Q on that opener Sentinels	4438.56	4.84	1
taking the lead Now by six taking the	4441.4	5.68	1
attack side of split where loud still	4443.4	5.92	1
also has a pretty decent split side on	4447.08	4.88	0
defense an opportunity to fight back and	4449.32	5.8	0
the fight starts for Mid control look at	4451.96	4.12	1
this	4455.12	3.559	1
wall louds put up the Sentinels will	4456.08	3.96	1
have to weave through a bit if they do	4458.68	3.601	0
want to take uh a b male	4460.04	4.76	0
control jump Peaks to come	4462.28	5.0	0
through sedak would love to save those	4464.8	3.64	1
guiding lights and	4467.28	3.84	1
Trailblazers yeah wins that wins that	4468.44	5.4	1
one rather qy K and sedak low on that HP	4471.12	5.2	1
and even senel resetting in the mid	4473.84	4.2	1
round pivoting towards this a side but	4476.32	3.2	1
still having a couple of players working	4478.04	3.679	1
towards B yeah smoke delay just came	4479.52	3.92	1
coming out of tuis there he's going to	4481.72	4.121	1
take a ramp control just for now and	4483.44	3.64	0
this is going to give loud the thought	4485.84	3.52	1
that they can rotate over towards that b	4487.08	4.88	1
side if if zelus can sell this okay the	4489.36	4.76	1
noise is already there from a	4491.96	4.199	1
yeah that Trailblazer comes up trying to	4494.12	3.84	1
find a timing as two spamming with his	4496.16	5.04	0
ghost through that smoke R cat reload	4497.96	5.52	1
yeah dog finds information towards be	4501.2	3.721	1
main but there's a beautiful flash	4503.48	4.159	1
double swing and look beautiful as a	4504.92	4.239	1
rotate for L looking for the pressure	4507.64	3.121	0
towards middle as well and we mentioned	4509.16	4.641	1
two lurkers on Sentinal side John Cy	4510.76	5.64	1
punishing that push from loud already a	4513.8	5.48	1
five on three as the Satchel comes in	4516.4	4.64	1
and will have a secured plant for	4519.28	5.919	1
Sentinels in the second pistol of split	4521.04	4.159	1
tough entry there you'll get sadok back	4526.28	5.68	1
over no utility to get back in this one	4528.84	4.12	0
so it's just going to be the three	4531.96	3.199	1
members to help with a fault line yeah	4532.96	5.719	0
five of Sentinels so a quick take by sen	4535.16	5.241	0
with a little bit of pressure around the	4538.68	3.681	0
map knowing what rotations might be	4540.4	4.08	1
coming through and just playing this	4542.36	3.56	1
wall a little bit and that small	4544.48	2.92	0
pressure that you mentioned that you	4545.92	3.2	0
mentioned rather towards that BS side	4547.4	4.16	1
kept SED do the whole round pretty much	4549.12	3.8	1
took a couple of seconds before he	4551.56	2.56	1
actually rotated back with the rest of	4552.92	3.4	1
the team to move in this aight for the	4554.12	3.72	1
attempt at the retake that will get	4556.32	4.28	1
fully denied by Sentinels only losing	4557.84	6.12	0
SAU in the process yep pulling those	4560.6	5.44	0
members to Anchor the site longer than	4563.96	4.4	0
they need to Sentinels seem to have such	4566.04	6.32	0
a read on what loud does right	4568.36	6.4	1
now see what happens the sheriff here	4572.36	4.48	1
for Les feeling pretty good with a bit	4574.76	4.12	1
of that money as we watch the	4576.84	4.92	0
replay combined	4578.88	6.0	0
retake get back into their Spike and	4581.76	5.68	0
Sentinels find that first round so loud	4584.88	4.799	0
did grab three it kind of takes the	4587.44	3.88	0
pressure off of losing that pistol but	4589.68	4.681	0
it never feels good to not get the start	4591.32	5.6	1
two bies going in for loud here trying	4594.36	3.839	1
to play it Coast to the chest and	4596.92	3.239	1
hopefully get some of these angles right	4598.2	3.601	1
on top of	4600.16	3.881	1
Sentinels they're going to work the wall	4601.8	3.8	1
still with a bit of hesitation on the	4604.04	2.96	1
left side of the map to see if loud	4605.6	4.0	1
wants to push you been pinging it out	4607.0	4.159	1
yeah that's going to be one of their big	4609.6	3.599	1
things coming into the into the gun	4611.16	4.441	1
rounds if loud cannot get extremity	4613.2	4.401	1
control this is where you start	4615.6	4.0	1
understanding the play style of loud L	4617.6	3.079	1
that they have they usually have	4619.6	2.84	1
shotguns to work with this time two bies	4620.68	3.681	1
for Cen to die so as soon as a fault	4622.44	4.0	1
line came out instant wall instant	4624.36	4.0	1
camera just to try to spot players	4626.44	3.96	1
running through and as nothing really	4628.36	4.56	1
happens to playing around this map	4630.4	4.68	1
around the a	4632.92	5.08	1
site it really kind of leaves kadine pin	4635.08	5.48	1
here in this position so then the	4638.0	4.6	0
pressure comes back towards Les the	4640.56	4.76	0
trail is now spots cow who goes for	4642.6	5.24	1
another fall line the long range	4645.32	6.48	1
connect takes down take down	4647.84	6.92	1
Z there is that bait allowing last to	4651.8	4.839	1
just swing out from the back of the map	4654.76	3.36	1
beautifully done for the crossfire set	4656.64	3.241	0
up for loud he was looking pretty good	4658.12	4.2	1
for C so far but somehow theoric play	4659.88	6.799	1
comes out 2v2 30 Q's only with pistols	4662.32	6.64	1
app PL for heaven both players still	4666.68	5.121	1
falling back in the back of the a site	4668.96	5.64	1
two flashes still available for still a	4671.8	4.72	1
pretty good position now for the attack	4674.6	4.2	1
pulse plant what a second round are they	4676.52	4.24	0
really going to steal this	4678.8	5.8	1
away not at this point no only just	4680.76	5.36	1
paranoia though might have an	4684.6	3.44	0
opportunity to isolate one but it's a	4686.12	3.64	0
double swing right after nice little	4688.04	3.72	1
bait here allowing to get the killing at	4689.76	4.52	1
least stopped the pressure that loud was	4691.76	4.36	1
almost converting there	4694.28	5.6	0
ony that got sketchy and Sentinels buys	4696.12	5.24	1
will still be pretty sketchy coming into	4699.88	4.0	1
this round due those frags from loud	4701.36	4.52	1
but it loud needs to start securing the	4703.88	4.92	1
rounds they're not really even able to	4705.88	5.6	1
cycle ALS like we see Sentinels doing on	4708.8	5.52	1
their round so the advantages aren't	4711.48	5.759	1
also coming from those factors it is	4714.32	4.8	1
just tough for loud to find a way in	4717.24	6.321	1
this gun round however could start that	4719.12	6.48	1
momentum I think it was ding all the	4723.56	3.72	1
games that Grandma Zin was talking about	4725.6	4.68	1
here the next second yeah I mean he was	4727.28	4.6	1
doing jump M before this too just	4730.28	2.64	1
getting the vibe getting his move	4731.88	3.52	1
movement down we know Z's movement is	4732.92	4.44	1
one of the Prime things he's known for	4735.4	5.04	1
so always doing that here he goes no	4737.36	7.279	1
satchels behind the The Flash though Zen	4740.44	5.64	1
couldn't get that kill but there is that	4744.64	4.841	1
sedak judge avoids it you saw the stun	4746.08	4.8	0
turning back so it's a fake to turn	4749.48	2.759	1
around and actually stun him to get the	4750.88	4.04	1
kill beautifully done by Sentinels two	4752.24	4.881	1
now out in the open second as across	4754.92	5.239	0
with his own judge opening up the Beast	4757.12	5.16	1
site a plant for main TS on the boxes	4760.16	4.281	1
looking towards to spawn there's only	4762.28	5.0	1
last so far as his other	4764.44	4.719	1
teammates feels like they're leaving him	4767.28	4.12	1
for dead there is still holding towards	4769.16	5.321	1
middle and a as T picks up the kill it's	4771.4	5.0	1
an absolute master class right now from	4774.48	4.4	0
Sentinels across these two maps looking	4776.4	4.36	0
they the way they took male let's just	4778.88	3.64	1
think about that the Trailblazer goes	4780.76	3.879	1
through and you think it's a vandal that	4782.52	4.04	1
would verse a judge but no T gets a	4784.64	3.481	1
guardian kill on the judge that's	4786.56	3.96	1
waiting that did not even get stunned	4788.12	5.599	1
like that is crazy the things you think	4790.52	5.6	1
should fall to the Wayside for Sen are	4793.72	4.52	1
going in their favor cuz they're all	4796.12	3.88	1
behind each other on these calls and	4798.24	3.92	1
they are making it work as a team an	4800.0	4.199	1
incredible team coming into the season	4802.16	4.601	1
important kills to save now for qck and	4804.2	5.201	1
gaad Zine where John CU is moving	4806.76	4.52	1
forward with his teammates putting the	4809.4	3.319	1
camera up spawning that raise and	4811.28	2.76	1
there's that pinch from the other side	4812.72	5.0	1
too at towards the ropes one to fall the	4814.04	5.48	1
second one stays alive so at least they	4817.72	3.201	1
kept the stronger weapon alive that's	4819.52	4.04	1
qck the dualist with the bandal	4820.92	3.92	1
but it's still map point though	4823.56	4.72	1
nonetheless for Sentinels map point with	4824.84	6.72	1
ice box in the mix	4828.28	7.6	1
next see this play once again just after	4831.56	7.079	1
talking about how Z is Vibe and his	4835.88	5.72	1
feeling it he gets a nice jumping drift	4838.64	4.761	1
in there into B site to open it up with	4841.6	4.16	1
the judge they have so many options so	4843.4	3.96	1
many variables I don't think we've	4845.76	4.0	1
really seen the same round from sen here	4847.36	4.799	1
on attack as they've been moving from	4849.76	5.479	1
that N9 three-core	4852.16	3.08	1
line hoping to get something done here	4855.48	5.4	1
with that Vandal from qck the force by	4857.72	4.801	1
of course coming through for loud so the	4860.88	3.4	1
two strongest weapons is two vandals to	4862.52	4.6	1
work with but it's spread thin here on	4864.28	3.6	1
the	4867.12	4.64	1
defense thin also on utility with 115	4867.88	6.04	1
left on the clock there's no paranoia	4871.76	5.12	1
only one flash left from sadak	4873.92	4.319	1
thankfully Kine is still there to	4876.88	3.04	1
support towards the a side with his own	4878.24	3.92	1
flashes and breach utility so all	4879.92	3.4	0
they're trying to right now on the	4882.16	3.361	0
inside is trying to delay with that util	4883.32	3.6	0
go for the crossfire set up on the top	4885.52	2.119	0
of	4886.92	3.759	1
mid it makes sense I mean use your fault	4887.64	4.321	1
line to get it back create an	4890.68	2.681	1
opportunity with it the first time they	4891.96	3.759	0
try to get a quick peek towards mid so	4893.36	4.52	0
Cowen Zen relying on that to be back and	4895.72	3.841	0
probably timing it just right that	4897.88	3.56	0
they'll have this a hold as they get	4899.56	3.88	1
over to the right side of the map it is	4901.44	3.6	1
going to be the lurk from Sassi this	4903.44	4.04	1
vent lurk again we keep seeing in the 14	4905.04	5.679	1
and it becomes such a big Kingpin for	4907.48	7.12	0
the round sassy fakes towards B main	4910.72	5.52	1
Seekers are out and they're going to	4914.6	3.72	1
start moving here 30 seconds left there	4916.24	5.0	0
it is oh absolutely ridiculous they're	4918.32	5.44	0
So Far Behind Enemy Lines loud doesn't	4921.24	4.601	0
even know just because of that pick that	4923.76	3.879	0
allows that pick to happen for a second	4925.84	4.28	0
on the as one was falling back now	4927.64	4.6	0
players are falling down towards the a	4930.12	5.28	0
side Cen alone Guardian cannot hold	4932.24	5.361	0
cannot hold the doors 10 seconds left	4935.4	5.36	0
there only one left two East B sight	4937.6	5.32	0
Guardian as well no flash as we	4940.76	4.6	0
mentioned Sentinels a full roster on the	4942.92	5.16	0
post plant it's looking like a done deal	4945.36	5.04	0
he's even walking the whole time they	4948.08	5.92	0
respected SEL so much on these lurks on	4950.4	6.839	1
these off these pul	4954.0	3.239	1
plants just going to probably look	4957.72	6.041	1
to Pat some stats up here there's that	4960.64	4.361	0
first	4963.76	4.84	0
one 10 low	4965.0	3.6	1
HP and there is that swing out finally	4969.32	8.16	1
getting the last pick sendal are one map	4973.0	7.679	1
away of winning the kickoff here in	4977.48	5.199	1
Americas some power they're looking to	4980.68	4.52	1
clear people in two shots so you expect	4982.68	5.921	1
those sheriffs to stay close hip to	4985.2	5.52	0
hip push up towards B they're going to	4988.6	4.24	1
get tens off of the site right	4990.72	4.96	0
away it's not only Sheriff but also a	4992.84	4.68	0
lot of ghosts	4995.68	3.881	0
now basically it's going to become a	4997.52	5.08	1
brawl oh he stays fundamentals and trade	4999.56	6.079	1
stay over all of them are bled t with	5002.6	6.079	1
three kills in the round last one to go	5005.64	5.52	1
finally denied by twois but he's all	5008.68	5.96	1
alone and second again the twinsies come	5011.16	5.761	1
out to work and the last thing loud	5014.64	4.08	1
wanted to see is a pistol round like	5016.92	3.64	1
that on map three from	5018.72	5.681	1
Sentinels absolutely incredible Outlaw	5020.56	8.24	1
coming in as well holy crap if tens felt	5024.4	6.279	1
like he was online in the other games	5028.8	4.56	1
this one just got turned turn on line as	5030.68	4.881	1
well how does he find these timings	5033.36	4.879	1
remember the last time with an op in the	5035.56	5.119	1
Smoke getting some kills on split shorty	5038.24	4.121	1
coming through this time getting a	5040.68	3.601	1
perfect timing for this flash to Blind	5042.36	4.08	1
everybody down on Lou side and get a	5044.28	3.64	1
three piece of his	5046.44	3.96	1
own he's going to be a force to be	5047.92	4.16	1
reckoned with right now on this	5050.4	4.0	1
map loud trying to change the pace	5052.08	4.88	1
aggressive now towards the aide sassy	5054.4	5.04	1
Falls quick pipe shot you see both of	5056.96	4.6	1
the walls over towards B quickly going	5059.44	3.84	1
up they're going to hit towards a so	5061.56	3.88	1
they try to draw attention and qck is	5063.28	3.52	1
going to pick another one up as second	5065.44	3.799	1
answers back yeah but then we have that	5066.8	4.439	0
ads from kaen picking up the Bulldog	5069.24	4.361	0
that was left behind Z and Falls so the	5071.24	4.201	0
outlaw will not be able to get picked up	5073.6	4.48	1
yet to allow these Pawn shots to happen	5075.44	4.679	1
you definitely do see L here one shot AV	5078.08	3.76	1
anything here with the outlaw or also	5080.12	3.841	1
just spamming with these rifles the	5081.84	6.52	1
submachine guns the Spectre to get the	5083.96	6.96	1
kill but after that first initial push	5088.36	5.319	1
coming out from John cue L seems to be	5090.92	4.199	1
in a very good position to hold this	5093.68	3.48	1
post	5095.12	6.12	1
plant slow push in back control the site	5097.16	5.361	0
they just trade whatever they're	5101.24	3.801	1
defending right now so loud can fire all	5102.52	5.159	1
the way in okay nice shot pushing	5105.04	4.599	1
forward to two versus one it's up to	5107.68	3.801	1
twois alone once again and that wall is	5109.64	3.08	1
going to be annoyed deal he gets the	5111.48	3.36	1
first kill s is trying to stick it but	5112.72	4.44	1
two is gets the pick the r b clutcher	5114.84	4.52	1
tie up the game early on ice box and	5117.16	5.681	1
Loud Comes Alive much earlier in this	5119.36	5.6	1
game it has to feel good for them to	5122.84	4.44	1
find ground right now the first two maps	5124.96	6.36	1
went 40 5 before loud answered back not	5127.28	4.839	1
this	5131.32	2.839	1
time we're going to see him a little bit	5132.12	3.801	1
more hungry here as we get into round	5134.16	4.601	1
three after this replay loud feeling	5135.92	7.0	1
good after the second round by to win	5138.76	6.84	1
after losing	5142.92	2.68	0
pistol still Smiles still vibing can	5146.4	6.96	1
never count loud out Cascade for forward	5149.8	5.28	1
still working this wall on to B but now	5153.36	3.279	1
they have Harbor's wall to take towards	5155.08	3.76	1
a as qck another first kill of the round	5156.64	4.401	1
time for SEL to push out quick and that	5158.84	5.0	1
Cask was annoying to deal with at least	5161.04	3.92	1
they got the kill out of that for	5163.84	2.799	1
Sentinels with the low bu that they have	5164.96	5.759	0
whole Classics actually just utility	5166.64	6.401	0
yeah really the plan was trying to get	5170.72	4.601	0
tens with orb a death allows for him to	5173.04	4.96	0
get the KO alt in the next round for	5175.32	5.04	1
loud it's a reset using utility now to	5178.0	5.08	1
clear towards the a site he throwing up	5180.36	4.56	1
a swing through the Viper wall beautiful	5183.08	4.4	1
Kill from c z Onin and once again	5184.92	5.16	1
nullifying the surprise attacks that SEL	5187.48	5.08	1
are trying to do little bit of Pop shots	5190.08	5.68	1
andly two gets the pick up the El's this	5192.56	5.36	1
lucking clean right now for loud's	5195.76	4.12	1
conversion off the Thrifty that they	5197.92	6.239	1
just got on round number two clean cut	5199.88	7.52	1
clear they take a sight they take down	5204.16	4.681	1
Sentinels for another round like you	5207.4	3.6	1
said Sentinels buying Classics seeing	5208.84	4.319	0
that a lot more from Team teams able to	5211.0	4.36	1
fill up the utility and it actually	5213.16	3.761	1
feels good because if you do go down	5215.36	3.24	1
with your classic you have utility	5216.92	4.12	0
coming into this round now so just get	5218.6	4.0	1
the dip into the pocket a little bit and	5221.04	2.92	1
you already have what you need to be	5222.6	3.32	1
throwing at your	5223.96	4.84	1
opponent utility and weapons for sure	5225.92	4.4	0
right right operator's going to be	5228.8	3.439	1
coming online here as we see Zack	5230.32	4.76	1
spending a little bit more still quite a	5232.24	5.841	1
few away from the ultimate on orbs so	5235.08	4.92	1
this op hopefully coming into play for	5238.08	4.72	1
them let see once loud figures out that	5240.0	4.639	1
might change their tune coming into this	5242.8	3.879	1
round but they are going to go for this	5244.64	4.441	1
pressure quickly on to Long be here D	5246.68	4.96	0
Miss so it allows John potentially get a	5249.08	4.559	1
surprise attack but just saw that jiggle	5251.64	4.841	1
peek out m l falls back in instantly one	5253.64	4.6	1
of those plays that L likes to do here	5256.48	4.679	1
is go aggressive instantly stop and try	5258.24	5.0	1
to Reit right after get into timing out	5261.16	4.681	1
for the defensive side alen drone gets	5263.24	4.361	1
denied not too much information but at	5265.84	3.16	1
least a reckoning comes out to clear out	5267.6	3.119	1
the site there's still players outside	5269.0	3.199	1
the perimeter though of this Reckoning	5270.72	4.041	1
on Cal side KO Al that we talked about	5272.2	4.96	1
before T has now activated it flash	5274.76	4.12	1
being thrown T falls down becomes a	5277.16	4.04	1
camera allowing John cuy to get these	5278.88	4.96	1
two picks now off the post plant there's	5281.2	4.641	1
a super late lur right now from Les two	5283.84	4.279	1
Snake Bites available wall is still up	5285.84	4.96	1
Cascade now being thrown exactly	5288.12	5.0	1
nullifying that but also allowing here T	5290.8	4.76	1
to come back up there is that res one	5293.12	4.321	1
flash that could be huge right now to	5295.56	4.0	1
use for both of the Defenders dizzy	5297.44	3.719	1
comes out tens gets ready to move	5299.56	3.04	1
forward John Q to get the pick on the	5301.16	3.881	0
twois the push for that flash allows	5302.6	4.84	0
zelus to get the pick Les becomes the	5305.04	5.56	1
last player standing also dropped by zel	5307.44	6.12	1
Asal will get a Flawless on diffuse once	5310.6	6.84	1
they got tens up reset they launched	5313.56	6.76	0
everything at yellow y we saw the	5317.44	4.48	0
entirety of loud back there double	5320.32	3.319	0
taking on which corner they wanted to	5321.92	3.44	1
peek at and then trying to dodge the	5323.64	3.801	1
mollies they were hitting around	5325.36	5.279	1
them incredible hit John cue finding two	5327.44	5.52	1
there was super big making the rest of	5330.64	4.52	1
this less pressured on the side of	5332.96	4.12	1
Sentinels as they retook also very nice	5335.16	3.48	1
to see as we talked about the Stop and	5337.08	3.76	1
Go that loud is doing that senel could	5338.64	3.881	0
also do that on their retakes hey the	5340.84	3.2	0
walls are blocking us let's just res	5342.52	3.36	1
tense and then we'll use more utility on	5344.04	4.639	1
the second wave so very well done good	5345.88	5.839	1
calls on the Fly here from the igl's as	5348.68	5.841	1
loud on sadak side is calling loud to	5351.72	4.52	1
try to push very aggressively behind the	5354.52	3.48	1
Cascade and trying to clear out the a	5356.24	4.161	1
site once again this KO from 10	5358.0	4.36	1
continues to nullify the utility the	5360.4	4.52	1
kazin's trying to bring allowing Zin to	5362.36	4.56	1
be posted up and get the first Blood	5364.92	4.719	1
against qck they couldn't clear a sight	5366.92	5.759	1
fully of the oper the Cascade forwards	5369.64	5.48	0
just waited out by Zen and then they	5372.68	5.841	0
fire back Cowen Zen able to trade now on	5375.12	6.961	1
to 10 oh oh utility the Marx goes on the	5378.52	6.32	1
ground bounces off bl's head who turns	5382.08	4.4	1
around says wait a minute with another	5384.84	3.76	0
kill there on to John C to even a third	5386.48	4.759	1
to dash away the quad denied by second	5388.6	6.72	0
but go is there for the trade one slight	5391.24	7.641	0
mistake and you saw how SEL just lost	5395.32	6.44	0
that round yeah Sentinels as well has	5398.88	5.759	1
been looking at a relatively timid	5401.76	6.2	1
timing from the loud Squad in all these	5404.64	5.241	0
maps and you almost see that there as	5407.96	3.64	0
sassi's ready to throw one and be like	5409.88	3.239	1
they're still coming into wait a minute	5411.6	3.84	1
they're in sight yeah that's the timing	5413.12	5.04	1
loud's trying to play right now right in	5415.44	6.16	1
your face awesome stuff loud turning the	5418.16	7.08	1
heat up cine now with the ultimate on	5421.6	5.76	1
the hunter Fury we saw this being used a	5425.24	4.44	1
lot on Lotus right off the rip to deter	5427.36	4.64	1
something that the defense was doing or	5429.68	3.921	1
the offense was	5432.0	3.96	1
doing and we'll see if it clears out the	5433.6	4.8	1
position of yellow or right under Nest	5435.96	3.8	1
where John cue was playing the other	5438.4	4.719	1
round he doubled up Focus towards B Les	5439.76	5.64	1
watching the rear here and Sentinels are	5443.12	4.761	1
playing little more timid after seeing	5445.4	4.36	1
loud's aggression on that last	5447.88	5.44	1
round you and scaling behind here the Y	5449.76	6.52	1
drone once again green control orb up	5453.32	5.28	1
for grabs M it seems as though we're	5456.28	4.52	0
trying to go for the quick yellow	5458.6	5.24	0
control John CD just waiting post it up	5460.8	4.2	0
for two of his teammates around the	5463.84	2.92	0
corner also watching flank under the	5465.0	4.48	0
tube viers pit up as they pick up the	5466.76	5.76	0
orb so they have it available for less	5469.48	5.92	0
there's a swing on both ends Nano swarm	5472.52	4.8	1
to the L A do from pushing forward and	5475.4	3.759	1
trying to get this plant down underand	5477.32	3.879	1
flash a swing out of that one blinds two	5479.16	4.881	1
t pick the kill plant then comes down	5481.2	4.321	1
instantly though zelus gets the kill	5484.04	2.28	1
onto	5485.52	4.04	1
sedak a two versus four disadvantage for	5486.32	5.44	1
loud those two ultimates are still	5489.56	3.88	1
available and he might try to delay as	5491.76	3.56	1
much as they can for coward Zen's hunted	5493.44	4.199	1
security to do some damage as that's one	5495.32	4.0	1
slight mistake there Le is able to	5497.64	4.201	0
punish it and that pit could be very	5499.32	4.319	0
detrimental for the retake of Sentinels	5501.84	3.6	0
snake bite on the ground wingman's	5503.64	4.441	1
trying to the fuse it so far less	5505.44	6.64	1
Falls and wingman gets to the fuse van	5508.08	6.119	1
Sly you mentioned something really	5512.08	4.36	1
awesome on the last round is that those	5514.2	4.96	1
the walls that we saw loud beat with	5516.44	4.6	1
using to encroach farther into the	5519.16	4.321	1
territory get to snowman push them off	5521.04	4.44	1
are being used by Sentinels to pick up	5523.48	4.36	1
their util and their members sash is	5525.48	4.32	1
able to throw a free dizzy recollect	5527.84	4.04	1
dizzy with the harbor Cascade or wall up	5529.8	4.48	1
whichever one was there and then they	5531.88	5.6	1
rehit the site again using loud's walls	5534.28	5.919	1
against them on this B retake we'll have	5537.48	5.0	1
to see how that get switched up	5540.2	4.161	0
pressure forward to not allow those	5542.48	4.239	0
walls to be so efficient for sels three	5544.36	4.799	0
ultimates here for loud we're back now	5546.72	4.321	0
to a tied one one of our closest to the	5549.16	4.881	0
series here as Sentinels ran away with	5551.04	5.48	1
the early rounds of the first few Maps	5554.04	4.199	1
does not see seem like loud to let that	5556.52	4.119	1
happen here a low bu on some members	5558.24	4.641	1
allow but still those ultimates are what	5560.64	4.641	1
they want to execute same type of play	5562.88	4.52	0
here just trying to have second give him	5565.28	5.399	0
an opportunity to get a op pick alen Jo	5567.4	5.759	0
knif comes out canel no information so	5570.68	3.841	1
we're going back and forth it seems like	5573.16	3.201	1
deja vu in round number	5574.52	4.719	1
seven will they be ready for Z posted at	5576.36	4.319	1
the same spot looking towards the pipes	5579.24	3.361	1
and yes they are cuz looks like La was	5580.68	4.56	1
trying to move down towards 410 instead	5582.6	4.599	1
SAS ready to greet them though pushing	5585.24	3.88	1
forward s gets that pick AR going to	5587.2	3.721	1
trade it off less with the lur that they	5589.12	3.08	0
mentioned on the desk but he gets	5590.92	3.36	1
spotted by the turret and zelis is going	5592.2	4.44	1
to be on a One V one in that section	5594.28	3.879	1
meanwhile though able to get the lock	5596.64	3.681	1
down up on the attack which will	5598.16	5.0	1
potentially allow l to move in and get a	5600.32	5.68	1
plant thrash already used on this great	5603.16	5.48	1
job by loud to avoid that and be able to	5606.0	5.28	0
kind of skirt around that ultimate of	5608.64	4.681	0
sashy here now Sentinels with the retake	5611.28	4.72	0
loud they are ready the knife is in the	5613.32	4.28	1
back of the site does not spot anybody	5616.0	3.48	1
so SEL could start working forward of	5617.6	4.16	1
the site a tradeoff that happens back	5619.48	4.48	1
and forth two again in a clutch	5621.76	4.959	1
situation against John C ints tap on the	5623.96	5.08	1
spike it's not really for him no so he	5626.72	3.761	1
has to lurk up and that high tide is	5629.04	4.76	1
going to be annoy but it was T gets the	5630.48	7.239	1
r ACR and wins that	5633.8	9.08	1
fight IG coming up strong again John cue	5637.72	6.721	1
these situations that you put him in you	5642.88	4.239	0
see him coming out on top quite a bit	5644.44	4.36	0
and for a pressure to be on a new player	5647.12	3.52	0
it does not seem like it affects him all	5648.8	3.359	1
that much grabs the operator they're	5650.64	2.801	1
going to have that going into the next	5652.16	3.161	1
round as that's been traded back and	5653.44	3.64	1
forth a little bit	5655.32	4.52	1
here you should run as we see this play	5657.08	4.92	1
right through window from Spawn picking	5659.84	4.6	1
up the first	5662.0	5.28	1
one and just having to dislodge the rest	5664.44	5.16	1
of loud out of the sight	5667.28	5.919	1
here crazy to be able to come in 3v2	5669.6	5.68	1
easily taking down the members there	5673.2	3.641	1
John cutie for the 1 V one now	5675.28	3.52	1
ultimate's ready for him zelis has the	5676.84	4.64	1
retake so they can ensure this to be a	5678.8	5.28	0
next round if they get that retake going	5681.48	4.48	1
just right we look at the side aloud	5684.08	3.96	1
they're going to call the timeout hun	5685.96	4.88	1
Fury is still there for cenen you have	5688.04	5.76	1
Bladestorm now coming up for qck what's	5690.84	5.64	1
the effect because we know the loud comp	5693.8	6.28	1
isn't using qck as OS was used right	5696.48	5.32	1
it's more flexible they can do what they	5700.08	3.44	1
want but also if they want him to	5701.8	3.8	1
aggress they can how do they give him	5703.52	3.719	1
that space though with this composition	5705.6	3.039	1
you don't you're not really throwing	5707.24	3.121	1
flashes over a wall you're not doing too	5708.64	3.721	1
much not flashing anybody to be honest	5710.36	3.359	1
you're just breaking crosshairs and	5712.36	3.6	1
technically for loud so far on their	5713.72	4.44	1
attack they can't do whatever they want	5715.96	3.719	1
because again when it comes down to the	5718.16	5.121	1
initiator battle between cow rather ands	5719.68	6.361	1
that knife denies so much information	5723.28	5.2	1
for L to really try to gain that space	5726.04	4.159	1
to move together or even get some pings	5728.48	4.36	0
out so senel so far on the initial hits	5730.2	4.401	1
coming out from L they could always stay	5732.84	4.359	1
posted up really yeah and you continue	5734.6	4.48	1
with the same great protocols that they	5737.2	3.44	1
have on the retakes I mean they've got	5739.08	3.92	0
four diffuses uh three diffuses so far	5740.64	4.201	1
in the four rounds that they won loud	5743.0	3.04	1
had to figure out a way to hold the	5744.84	3.48	0
pulse	5746.04	2.28	0
plant all right	5749.64	6.6	0
scattered low armor across both	5752.84	5.96	0
teams trying to get an upper operator	5756.24	4.4	1
shot here just to start off the round on	5758.8	4.399	1
some high lows very big pick from Zack	5760.64	4.801	0
and he's going to stay yeah he's got	5763.2	3.761	1
support there dizy to try to get more	5765.44	3.08	1
information instead there's a second	5766.96	3.719	1
jump CLA is coming through so they know	5768.52	4.0	1
the pressure is coming in towards loud	5770.68	3.761	1
but look at that instant pivot two	5772.52	3.4	0
players now pushing forward towards the	5774.44	3.679	0
aite to rotate coming across as well orb	5775.92	3.68	0
which should soon be coming up towards	5778.12	3.961	1
middle here to allow for them to CR	5779.6	4.92	1
meanwhile the same good old thing this	5782.08	5.68	1
time not being sadak because it's C Ona	5784.52	4.599	0
using the AL drone to bait out the	5787.76	3.439	0
players of SEL out towards this B sign	5789.12	4.241	0
and they walk slowly towards a full	5791.2	4.681	0
retake set up now for that side all loud	5793.36	4.48	0
has to deal with is the ultimate or	5795.88	4.6	0
sorry utility from zelis and that's just	5797.84	4.92	1
delay denial probably won't come up with	5800.48	3.8	1
too much they'll be able to wait this	5802.76	3.439	1
out and the Reckoning gives lets them	5804.28	5.2	1
know this space is free qk and goes even	5806.2	7.52	1
further got Hunter Fury want to unless Q	5809.48	7.04	0
could do something Ash is so out of	5813.72	5.52	1
position not going to be able to use it	5816.52	4.48	1
he going to be in a one and done for qck	5819.24	3.521	1
gets a pick at least before he gets	5821.0	4.159	1
traded out by z a four versus four	5822.76	3.68	1
trying to use the hunter Fury for the	5825.16	3.321	1
pul SP instead Zin gets the pick up the	5826.44	4.12	1
qck as Nanos storms are now trying to	5828.48	3.92	0
delay here on the attack side there's	5830.56	3.88	1
that Recon D coming through K rips out	5832.4	4.2	1
the hted fury but nobody's on the spike	5834.44	4.719	1
so far just a tap to actually bait out	5836.6	4.24	1
the alt here it comes the wingman to	5839.16	3.441	1
come out the start the theuse SOS are	5840.84	4.12	1
fighting for in front of the wall but	5842.6	4.079	1
the shot darts are coming out denies the	5844.96	2.8	1
wingman	5846.68	4.281	1
defuse couple kills coming across though	5847.76	4.879	1
are holding the ground s butt on the	5850.96	4.48	1
ground and there's no time left SAS on a	5852.64	4.761	1
one versus two hoping to make it	5855.44	3.44	1
expensive at least on the exit they're	5857.4	3.96	1
both ran out of ammo but both still die	5858.88	5.08	1
from the spike loud tie up the game four	5861.36	6.48	1
to four beautiful chaos of a round oh my	5863.96	6.92	1
gosh at one point John cue grabbed down	5867.84	6.08	1
to the rope to block wingman he was just	5870.88	4.64	1
sitting there holding on to the Rope	5873.92	4.12	1
spraying off of it that's crazy	5875.52	4.199	1
everybody just trying to body block	5878.04	3.52	1
there they're still able to get the U	5879.72	4.4	1
the viper bite actually coming up huge	5881.56	4.8	0
to cause the vulnerable there and uh	5884.12	3.801	0
little handshake to end the round high	5886.36	4.44	1
five between those two four to four now	5887.92	5.719	1
these rounds are getting chaotic this is	5890.8	5.68	1
awesome and see how the players are just	5893.64	4.96	1
kind of regaining control of what's been	5896.48	5.0	1
happening in sight we start this one off	5898.6	4.761	1
again the focus from loud starts with	5901.48	4.759	1
this B hit they tempt it they Cascade go	5903.36	5.08	1
with the Drone and see what they can get	5906.24	3.721	1
out of a fight here cuz Sentinels	5908.44	3.08	1
they've been given that Peak tens will	5909.96	3.48	1
be there or second they're trying to get	5911.52	3.639	1
a first kill that type of round reminds	5913.44	3.56	1
me of pearl all over again trying to	5915.16	3.48	1
play controller the PO Planet	5917.0	3.28	1
everybody's playing lineups and sprays	5918.64	3.721	1
through smokes you're just crossing your	5920.28	3.72	1
fingers to actually get the diffuser	5922.36	4.56	1
just need some Odin exactly start least	5924.0	4.36	1
it's been working for both teams	5926.92	2.64	1
sometimes you win some sometimes you	5928.36	2.48	1
lose some but it's a clean slate in	5929.56	3.8	1
round number nine four to four our score	5930.84	6.359	1
line sadak trying to push forward off an	5933.36	6.279	1
orb coming down on the defense TS only	5937.2	5.4	1
Shar alone underhand flash information	5939.64	4.761	1
but cine they were ready for that this	5942.6	4.841	1
time around cine and less all comes out	5944.4	6.12	1
denial attempt of a plant but Sak still	5947.44	5.44	1
is able to put it	5950.52	5.52	1
down wow loudest thing so much farther	5952.88	6.12	1
forward staying too yellow still pushing	5956.04	5.52	1
out from long nice UIL kill	5959.0	4.56	1
zelis is just dancing and dodging in	5961.56	4.44	1
there Nice kill by Kine who gets a third	5963.56	4.44	1
in the round even sedak I mean the traes	5966.0	5.199	1
are nice the positions great it does	5968.0	5.32	1
allow J Q to get anything done inside of	5971.2	4.44	1
his own pit so he's going to let that	5973.32	4.08	1
pit evaporate so he could save his	5975.64	4.841	0
weapon but loud able to fight back and	5977.4	4.56	0
take the lead now it's been a while	5980.48	3.32	1
since we've seen loud having some sort	5981.96	4.56	1
of commanding lead yeah Teamworks on	5983.8	4.52	1
point for loud here like we said this	5986.52	3.599	1
this composition doesn't just have one	5988.32	4.0	1
dashing in with free space being given	5990.12	4.441	1
by flashes and a bunch of utility it	5992.32	4.76	0
requires loud to be behind each other it	5994.56	4.639	1
takes a lot more to get this composition	5997.08	4.72	0
to work that loud is using you got to	5999.2	5.281	0
remember that very easy for Sentinels to	6001.8	4.64	0
pick apart the Gap close if they can't	6004.48	4.159	0
reach QC on the dash right he's left out	6006.44	5.52	1
on an island everything loud does has to	6008.64	5.96	1
be in sync and here they collect a	6011.96	5.04	1
really nice round at B they get the	6014.6	4.401	1
ultimate out of John Cy as well so they	6017.0	3.639	1
have to deal with less going into this	6019.0	4.36	1
round not their own teammate but five to	6020.64	7.361	1
four 10 round 10 rather pretty good buy	6023.36	7.0	1
here for loud to be looking at low armor	6028.0	5.28	1
by for the Sentinel	6030.36	6.6	1
side low armor by pushing exactly	6033.28	6.399	1
looking for aggression staying outside	6036.96	5.08	1
of the range of the Dizzy something that	6039.68	4.841	1
also EG struggle to taking control of	6042.04	5.52	1
green nonetheless loud scores First	6044.52	5.36	0
Advantage as zelus is under heavy heavy	6047.56	3.599	1
pressure forc the fall back back in the	6049.88	3.0	0
back of the sight M moving forward to	6051.16	3.921	1
the way as s gets two looks back at the	6052.88	3.88	1
top of the 41 as two takes him down	6055.08	3.44	1
though still the advantage comes out the	6056.76	3.879	1
orb for a plant on the top of the a	6058.52	3.8	0
tower coming out from	6060.64	4.361	0
Loud N come in available for T if they	6062.32	5.16	0
want to try to retake this one but it	6065.0	4.36	0
comes down to if they can get these	6067.48	4.84	1
picks and they cannot Tu looking clean	6069.36	5.68	1
on those two tu's toying with them here	6072.32	5.96	1
and look at Reckoning up again we just	6075.04	6.28	1
saw that clear a sight for loud into a	6078.28	4.56	1
this is what we saw from Z in the	6081.32	3.319	1
previous maps of just raise Al after	6082.84	4.799	1
raise Al loud is collecting those alt	6084.64	5.361	1
they're collecting s's head right now	6087.64	5.441	1
and they want this fourth map real bad	6090.0	5.92	0
three ultimates to be used is Saucy does	6093.08	5.119	1
that work but it was the work around	6095.92	3.96	1
still enough control over the site here	6098.2	4.92	1
for loud to be able to to control it	6099.88	5.279	1
okay I don't know if it would go	6103.12	5.12	1
in where are we going towards a again	6105.16	6.801	1
Reckoning held and ready	6108.24	4.841	1
BL storm	6111.96	3.04	1
available bumping into each other	6113.08	3.599	1
getting concussed by the Reckoning a	6115.0	2.76	1
ping coming	6116.68	4.081	1
out Z's able to dodge it though so that	6117.76	4.72	1
does no damage at all second dashing	6120.76	3.16	1
forward looking to reposition on the top	6122.48	3.679	1
of the a tower Q with the opener there's	6123.92	4.36	0
that pick but instantly traded out sadak	6126.16	3.641	0
on the top and they tried to do the null	6128.28	4.04	0
command on the Sentinel side but as they	6129.8	4.399	0
were doing a lot of noise for loud they	6132.32	3.68	0
stay back towards the site and just	6134.2	4.081	0
picked out sels on the retake trying to	6136.0	3.76	0
be a little bit more proactive and	6138.28	3.72	1
aggressive against loud	6139.76	5.479	1
he last with one John ctie here to try	6142.0	4.679	1
and clean up three it's going to be	6145.24	4.44	1
tough I love the choice these Final	6146.68	5.761	1
Shots come through you might look at Cen	6149.68	5.161	1
Zen's Hunter Hunter Fury and say why go	6152.44	4.6	1
after the jet why go after Zen well	6154.84	3.839	1
you're keeping the blad Storm Out of	6157.04	3.52	1
Sight he may updraft he may do a bunch	6158.68	3.96	1
of stuff to dodge it but your team has	6160.56	4.639	1
freedom from the Jets ultimate they just	6162.64	4.921	1
focused on orb to get that sight they	6165.2	4.44	1
don't have to deal it with an up drop	6167.56	4.32	1
they just focus	6169.64	4.201	1
for these type of kills that's an easy	6171.88	4.0	1
one why you all in the jet I'm not going	6173.84	4.879	1
to explain it but no great play there by	6175.88	4.799	1
Cowen Zen to actually take Ze out of the	6178.72	5.241	1
mix really heady stuff there very happy	6180.68	5.44	1
you see loud still vibing even when they	6183.96	3.88	1
were down they had the same Smiles on	6186.12	3.52	1
and they have to be feeling even better	6187.84	3.72	1
now van silly Final Round Here of the	6189.64	4.761	1
first half on map three loud comes back	6191.56	5.8	1
to take their first half possibly 8 to	6194.4	5.16	0
four we see the spike down so this is	6197.36	4.0	1
going to be a weighted out round they're	6199.56	3.639	1
seeing again if Sentinels will give them	6201.36	3.839	1
that Peak at yellow just to get that	6203.2	4.44	0
first fight L carrying the op in mid and	6205.2	3.641	0
finally Sentinels are able to take	6207.64	3.48	0
control of the aside pressure so you see	6208.84	4.48	0
how zelus and Zin are currently posted	6211.12	4.04	1
watching belt watching main so they know	6213.32	3.44	1
now that the hits coming towards the	6215.16	4.121	1
bite at least to start the early call	6216.76	5.0	1
from loud to take control of yellow as	6219.28	4.64	1
you mentioned here ri at the same time	6221.76	3.879	0
important to keep sasi alive cuz he has	6223.92	3.44	0
a thrash to work with there's the	6225.64	3.52	0
commitment now for allow for the first	6227.36	3.56	0
initial hit but they haven't really	6229.16	4.641	0
cross the line to try to tap a [ __ ] and	6230.92	6.239	0
try to waste that utility out	6233.8	3.359	1
first I'm going to stick this they're	6237.92	4.36	1
using a different wall now for Harbor	6240.4	3.799	1
they're not allowing those sections to	6242.28	4.64	1
be created as much as Sentinels retake	6244.2	5.04	1
this wall is covering mid and snowman	6246.92	4.56	1
entrance now straight across instead of	6249.24	4.88	1
diagonally an or Cascade goes forward	6251.48	4.92	1
they should be able to gain position get	6254.12	4.241	1
that default plant in and this is going	6256.4	4.44	0
to be hard to uproot loud with five	6258.36	4.96	0
alive but here comes thr to try thr and	6260.84	4.68	0
giving time for T even to rot to across	6263.32	4.919	0
and still get the pick though onto zelus	6265.52	4.56	1
as we got one looks like he was detained	6268.24	3.201	1
towards the back of yellow I think that	6270.08	3.8	1
was going to be less here but an off	6271.44	4.88	1
shot missed here by z q answering back	6273.88	4.64	1
on the 10 looking good for loud on the	6276.32	3.279	1
post	6278.52	4.28	1
plant you needed T to come across with	6279.6	5.0	0
these flashes to help but instead it's	6282.8	3.839	1
loud winning this pul plan pushing	6284.6	5.441	1
forward and dropping the igl again we	6286.64	5.321	1
talked about it took a while for loud	6290.04	5.04	1
and talking about loud with a definite	6291.96	5.12	1
strong lead in a map and they're	6295.08	3.76	1
definitely showing it here on ice box in	6297.08	4.48	1
a perfect correction to the way the wall	6298.84	6.52	1
was being used against them at B they	6301.56	5.96	1
throw that this wall from before the at	6305.36	3.839	1
the end of the round they do still throw	6307.52	3.199	1
the wall that covers snowman but look	6309.2	3.48	1
how far up they are now they're not at	6310.72	3.92	1
yellow trying to take the long distant	6312.68	5.601	1
fight well corrected by loud for the	6314.64	6.48	1
84 at least he's making me smile and	6318.28	4.319	1
Mimi indeed we can never count out the	6321.12	3.361	1
Brazilians now as they take the lead	6322.6	3.921	1
mentioned before a very strong first	6324.48	3.28	1
half that they shown on their attack	6326.52	2.88	1
this time Sentinels trying to see what	6327.76	4.2	1
they're going to look like on their own	6329.4	4.239	1
attack side we know that loud has been	6331.96	2.759	0
very annoying with this double	6333.64	2.881	1
controller against EG how they're able	6334.72	3.761	1
to lock down this bside and that's why	6336.52	4.0	1
SEL for the beginning of this pistol are	6338.48	4.4	1
looking to move five players with by the	6340.52	4.599	0
potential pul plant situation yeah it	6342.88	4.319	0
does you see the armor and the two	6345.12	4.08	0
mollies on zelis that makes me think	6347.2	3.841	0
zelis wants to be the last alive with a	6349.2	3.96	0
bit of protection and that Molly post	6351.04	3.679	0
plant let's see what Sentinels tries to	6353.16	4.121	0
do loud with great util dump into the	6354.72	6.44	1
side just got it and deny Sentinels and	6357.28	6.12	1
also Deni the two Nanos swarms that was	6361.16	3.721	1
going for that plant so that's going to	6363.4	3.44	1
be even more difficult for Sentinels to	6364.88	4.279	1
play that P plan staying anchored up	6366.84	3.52	1
that's the name of the game that's what	6369.16	3.281	1
they have to do when they can't until Z	6370.36	4.319	1
finally pops the first one against loud	6372.44	4.799	1
cow gets the flank onto 10 second is now	6374.68	4.96	1
alone the double swing high low and that	6377.24	5.321	1
looks really good a slight mistake on	6379.64	5.52	1
just waiting the timing of that plant	6382.56	5.88	0
denied by the shock darts of cine allows	6385.16	5.08	0
for them to score nine right and the	6388.44	3.48	1
focus that Zeal is with like you said	6390.24	4.041	1
was to have two Molly's post PL	6391.92	5.199	1
everything was instantly snuffed out by	6394.28	6.56	1
loud that was planned protocol at its	6397.12	5.281	1
best right there beautifully done you	6400.84	3.56	1
see it again in the shots just	6402.4	3.92	1
absolutely	6404.4	5.56	1
connecting a uh Far Cry indifference	6406.32	5.68	1
from what we had first round pistol of	6409.96	4.92	1
tens and zis just cleaning up the right	6412.0	5.76	1
side of the map loud finally get theirs	6414.88	4.56	1
they start off here in the second half	6417.76	3.359	1
exactly how they want but they're going	6419.44	3.719	1
to match up against Stingers it's not	6421.12	4.761	1
the classic buy from sen they're going	6423.16	4.52	0
right into this with	6425.88	4.56	0
aggression this going to be a reckoning	6427.68	5.841	0
buildup for tuis that seems to be the	6430.44	5.279	0
focus looks like SOS couldn't punish it	6433.52	4.0	0
cuz of the Cascade that came out so they	6435.72	5.4	1
cut noise in s and looking for the snow	6437.52	7.0	1
wall after the KO knife gets shot out	6441.12	4.761	1
double flash clearing out the back of	6444.52	3.599	1
the site once again just trying to bait	6445.88	4.839	1
out utility wingman though looking for	6448.12	4.48	1
the set of to plant for the a tower so	6450.72	4.281	1
changing things around just parkouring	6452.6	4.841	1
across the a site plant now comes down	6455.0	5.679	1
alen joone only spots Z but already loud	6457.44	5.6	1
has funneled back and pushed towards the	6460.68	4.641	1
back of the a site Sassi scores first	6463.04	4.559	1
long range with the stinger and	6465.32	4.0	1
definitely fighting forward alarm bot to	6467.6	3.241	1
also ring the bell allowing here	6469.32	2.879	1
Sentinels to try to fight back on the	6470.84	3.64	0
left side of 410 but Les is able to even	6472.2	4.081	0
up the tally the Stinger by from	6474.48	3.92	0
Sentinels they're trying to keep the	6476.28	4.839	0
weapons and the engagement Close n no	6478.4	4.92	0
storm getting a pick on to qck a three	6481.12	4.401	1
versus three as a time is in favor of	6483.32	4.96	1
SEL so far the high tide coming up TS	6485.52	4.679	1
with the longarm range Stinger once	6488.28	6.439	1
again s are able to score on the FL	6490.2	7.761	1
spy Sentinels push through on the four	6494.72	6.721	0
spy and completely take loud off guard	6497.96	5.239	0
no idea that was going to happen in	6501.44	3.679	1
sight and it wasn't a flank it's nothing	6503.2	4.361	1
out Sentinels behind each other pushing	6505.12	5.241	1
straight through sashy been incredible	6507.56	4.36	1
with the Stinger T has been incredible	6510.36	2.96	1
with the	6511.92	4.12	1
stinger and the positioning that they	6513.32	5.359	0
had as well on pipes was incredible to	6516.04	4.32	1
be able to pick up those kills that tens	6518.68	2.881	1
had there towards the end of the round	6520.36	4.0	1
and shut down the defuse wow Sal	6521.56	4.119	1
Sentinels come up huge there what are	6524.36	2.68	1
loud going to do they go to a Bucky they	6525.68	4.801	1
go to a low by Sentinels now can start	6527.04	7.119	1
to push for a possible win on this map	6530.48	6.52	1
they need to they need to tie it up but	6534.16	4.321	1
that could easily happen now with the	6537.0	2.8	1
way this would	6538.48	4.52	1
swing loud taking every precaution on	6539.8	5.879	1
the defensive side now sadok knows what	6543.0	4.4	1
to do in these situations they've been	6545.68	2.48	1
there	6547.4	2.88	1
before no different how they want to	6548.16	5.401	1
play this jigler cross spraying through	6550.28	5.959	1
the top of the a tower Les made it out	6553.56	4.44	1
with 22 HP remaining and instantly we're	6556.24	6.521	1
moving forward for a plant oh oh red	6558.0	7.48	1
looks like the ears were spotted there	6562.76	5.64	1
by sedak with the sheriff adsing down	6565.48	5.96	1
Bing the plant for them to move forward	6568.4	5.56	1
at least the backstab is there zelus	6571.44	4.719	1
watching that flame dropping qck flashes	6573.96	4.96	0
moving forward across the high tide you	6576.16	4.321	0
hear the repel second is just waiting	6578.92	2.6	1
behind	6580.48	3.679	1
it they're okay with it for SS there are	6581.52	5.88	1
playing against pistols at this	6584.16	3.241	1
point last guys can't really do too much	6588.8	3.879	1
you already see him going all the way	6591.32	4.72	1
back you just looking to run in and die	6592.68	6.081	1
from the spike	6596.04	2.72	1
after but SEL are looking pretty good so	6599.04	4.52	1
far getting that Force SP on that second	6601.44	3.36	1
round and winning the way that it did	6603.56	2.92	1
really fo the plans now for allowed to	6604.8	4.12	1
have a very strong start on the second	6606.48	5.08	1
half it down I mean I think they they	6608.92	4.96	1
quickly identified as well with the the	6611.56	5.28	1
Cascade they're seeing tuis having alts	6613.88	4.48	1
that they might have been able to to	6616.84	3.399	1
sting or Rush the second one catching	6618.36	4.239	1
loud off guard catching them in a in a	6620.24	4.041	1
position where they feel safe to grab an	6622.6	4.56	1
orb and then reset Sentinels they want	6624.28	6.2	1
to attack as fast as possible and just	6627.16	5.761	1
from screens there they're figuring out	6630.48	3.8	1
that they can take it down so there	6632.92	2.84	1
needs to be a little bit more protection	6634.28	3.12	1
as they head towards that Nest area for	6635.76	4.76	1
PL on wingman now I still love the uh	6637.4	6.04	1
the play that you saw there from hiding	6640.52	4.559	1
all the way back toward spawn get that	6643.44	4.6	1
pick and Dinos Spike allowing him to be	6645.08	3.961	1
one	6648.04	3.8	0
away from the	6649.04	5.24	1
ult of course it was the kill that was	6651.84	5.04	1
more important to get that ult point	6654.28	5.439	1
than his death from the spike in s and	6656.88	4.839	0
and allows for them to maybe try to look	6659.72	3.241	0
for that pressure to pick up that or	6661.72	3.081	0
towards bide cuz SEL never really took	6662.96	4.279	0
control of that bide but SEL in round	6664.8	5.68	0
number 16 decided to do it and they deny	6667.24	4.88	0
the opportunity of loud of building up	6670.48	3.84	0
ultimates here it's been a while since	6672.12	4.6	1
we've seen this little box shot the back	6674.32	5.44	1
of snowman you can hit on top of green	6676.72	4.281	0
and now they're	6679.76	4.359	0
waiting for qck it did look like that	6681.0	4.639	0
Dash went across I think he's got the	6684.12	3.56	0
call second can saw that little hair bun	6685.64	3.281	1
fly	6687.68	5.121	1
through and now they wait and they call	6688.92	6.0	1
such a good wait the patience of	6692.8	4.64	1
Sentinels causes loud to go for the full	6694.92	5.279	1
rotation expecting an a hit a free sight	6697.44	4.239	1
here and it's going to be the call from	6700.2	3.641	1
sedak that they need to come back what a	6701.68	3.92	0
deep	6703.84	4.279	0
plan oh they're still going they want to	6705.6	3.841	1
definitely try to start working and	6708.12	3.321	1
fighting towards the spawn you see a set	6709.44	3.759	1
up from T but this time he actually he	6711.44	3.719	1
doesn't have a flash to work with so	6713.2	3.4	1
it's really going to be Zin trying to	6715.16	2.96	1
catch one early sees that there's no	6716.6	2.841	0
early pressure coming out here's the	6718.12	4.241	0
alone falls back into sight instead so	6719.44	4.96	1
an opportunity now for allow to rescale	6722.36	4.279	0
for the retake in the B site Z behind	6724.4	4.799	0
the Cascade a one for one though one	6726.64	4.161	1
coming through blocking Vision on the	6729.2	3.44	1
left side of yellow three players posted	6730.8	3.439	1
up there for Sentinels on that post plan	6732.64	3.361	1
as well so you hear the utility coming	6734.24	4.44	1
out for the retemper take zelis on the	6736.0	4.599	1
top of green look at all that delay for	6738.68	3.881	1
that utility for sels on that pulse but	6740.6	4.0	1
as well and looks like we want to try to	6742.56	4.24	1
save to fight for another day to try to	6744.6	4.961	1
keep the op for qk oh my gosh but	6746.8	5.399	1
Sentinels will get	6749.56	2.639	1
seven six rounds for Sentinels to	6752.96	7.119	1
solidify themselves as the kings of	6756.32	6.6	1
Na it's crazy to think it's that close	6760.08	4.6	0
loud's still on the lead though this's	6762.92	3.08	1
work to be	6764.68	4.121	1
done see here this push through from	6766.0	5.88	1
Sentinels taking loud off guard and the	6768.8	6.2	1
play the macro on that round absolutely	6771.88	4.96	1
throwing loud and Sak for a loop you're	6775.0	2.92	1
definitely seeing the hope there from	6776.84	3.56	1
SEL for sure coming back in the second	6777.92	4.08	1
half when they were so strong on the	6780.4	3.52	1
defensive side for the beginning of the	6782.0	4.679	1
series or even for kickoff so far	6783.92	5.56	1
showing that they can have the momentum	6786.68	4.321	1
and the potential to really close out a	6789.48	3.759	0
very strong attack side on ice box as	6791.0	3.92	1
well as a change of pace change of	6793.24	4.041	1
position from loud same wall but from a	6794.92	4.4	1
different position to block out Vision	6797.28	5.48	1
on M and green zelus decides to walk up	6799.32	5.08	0
on this and the rest of SEL is holding	6802.76	3.839	1
behind it there's nobody really watching	6804.4	4.92	1
an asight push except for an alarm bot	6806.6	4.56	1
yeah and I I I find that interesting too	6809.32	2.879	1
that it's an alarm bot instead of a	6811.16	2.52	1
turret cuz somebody could now move up on	6812.2	4.561	1
the top of L so for me maybe SEL are	6813.68	4.641	1
really looking to commit towards this B	6816.76	3.399	1
sign exactly maybe the pace they move	6818.32	3.52	1
they feel comfortable just going forward	6820.16	4.361	1
knowing the back won't be timed and yeah	6821.84	3.92	1
they're going to get into position	6824.52	3.44	1
really fast here a stinger a guardian	6825.76	4.76	1
but the operator's there for QC did not	6827.96	4.759	1
expect Zin to be on top of yellow tuis	6830.52	5.159	1
with the wide swing and gets picked off	6832.72	5.041	1
qk is too far behind he's still	6835.68	4.0	1
anchoring towards the aite with that	6837.76	3.8	1
operator here's a chance here for	6839.68	4.361	1
Sentinels to move up Recon Dart prepped	6841.56	4.48	1
up ready but it shock darts instead same	6844.04	3.52	1
plant position behind the wall and	6846.04	3.36	1
there's no utility there to deny him and	6847.56	3.32	1
as I say that the shot guards came	6849.4	4.08	1
through a good way to recognize from	6850.88	4.4	1
last round to this round that loud can	6853.48	3.759	1
stop that plant that's the call from	6855.28	4.08	1
sadak saying they planted deep the team	6857.24	4.96	1
saw to we can deny that the next time	6859.36	4.839	0
they do it they have to have an	6862.2	3.52	0
important timing here as that's a nice	6864.2	4.201	0
shot from qck talk about s the Wall came	6865.72	3.88	1
up they can pick it up and try to go for	6868.4	3.839	1
a pla meanwhile coming out from celus	6869.6	5.161	1
who gets a pick onto sadak on middle ju	6872.24	5.081	1
K now no targets available for a pick	6874.76	3.919	1
with the operator especially when the	6877.32	3.399	1
Wall comes up zel is also lurking	6878.68	3.92	1
through towards that kitchen here's the	6880.72	3.761	1
shot from the operator here's the	6882.6	4.161	1
footsteps of cine falling back towards	6884.48	4.28	1
orange so the rest of L pressing forward	6886.76	3.76	1
towards yellow and a nice spam through	6888.76	4.8	1
the poison orb Q Falls now a tap on that	6890.52	4.76	1
Spike baiting out the swings from the	6893.56	3.84	1
Sentinels but no picks until celus gets	6895.28	4.64	1
the lurk kill one more to go celsus	6897.4	5.44	1
again with the lurk to put three in	6899.92	5.92	1
round and putting sels one run away up	6902.84	5.48	1
tying the game we heard Kaplan talking	6905.84	5.44	1
to smicks at halim about how it's John	6908.32	5.44	1
cue and zelis and you have to think that	6911.28	5.08	1
there was a lot of zalis going in to	6913.76	5.359	1
that round the timing the calls how much	6916.36	4.879	1
time they needed to defend in sight or	6919.12	4.641	1
play back in sight for him to get there	6921.24	5.521	1
in the flank controls the map we see	6923.76	4.52	1
zelus come up with two big ones there	6926.76	4.839	1
towards the end 9 to8 now Sentinels only	6928.28	5.76	1
trailing by one with the last four	6931.6	4.881	1
rounds in their favor get out of my way	6934.04	3.92	1
it's going to be a push down here loud	6936.48	3.56	1
wants to start to get aggressive even on	6937.96	4.32	1
their Low by they have to get under the	6940.04	3.84	1
skin of Sentinels here they can't keep	6942.28	4.52	1
playing default it seems qk just Hur the	6943.88	4.719	1
turret actually he's still in range	6946.8	4.799	1
where by somebody but instead just wants	6948.6	5.921	1
to deny visibility for Sentinels by	6951.6	5.04	0
breaking a turret early so Sentinels	6954.52	4.52	0
pushing towards the a side instead	6956.64	4.241	1
should be a wingman plan here trade back	6959.04	4.199	1
and forth nice shot by qck Dash	6960.88	4.759	1
activated as well Stinger upgrade back	6963.24	4.84	1
into the sheriff sank bite pushing away	6965.64	5.361	1
Reckoning instantly getting popped as	6968.08	5.6	1
Sassi gets the plant from the wing	6971.0	5.239	1
manist now there's that jump up sashy	6973.68	5.201	0
almost got that pick onto Les jumping up	6976.24	4.36	0
towards the a who does get a pick of his	6978.88	3.239	1
own with the sheriff we talk about the	6980.6	3.52	1
LLY here loud has to make plays and it's	6982.12	5.401	1
working out Aline no contact L with the	6984.12	7.201	1
wall bang onto S as well up to the igl	6987.52	5.92	1
John cue springing across left and right	6991.32	4.44	1
now let is sticking on that plant it's	6993.44	3.679	1
looking pretty good here to hold it in	6995.76	5.28	1
the end the lower by four L the Thrifty	6997.12	5.761	1
as the answer right back and that hope	7001.04	3.88	1
is slowly dwindling away here since	7002.88	4.48	1
Sentinels forced by in the second round	7004.92	4.6	1
of the half the Cove really putting it	7007.36	4.279	0
damper there on Sentinels trying to get	7009.52	4.599	0
to the spike Sai throws out a m just	7011.64	4.6	0
boink right	7014.12	4.761	0
off and that's crazy that he's able to	7016.24	4.561	0
get and break the turret down towards	7018.88	3.6	0
bottom M and still come back to get an	7020.8	5.04	1
opener on holding the a	7022.48	6.96	1
site loud making the perfect little	7025.84	5.759	1
Corrections here crash in this coming	7029.44	3.36	1
round and then they're going to have the	7031.6	3.04	1
sight with a lock down if they don't	7032.8	4.08	0
have that to hold for or if they if um	7034.64	3.921	0
they don't use it they can have it for	7036.88	3.44	0
the next round so a lot of things loud	7038.56	6.2	0
has to deal with right now sheriff for	7040.32	4.44	0
Less he's got money there wait a minute	7044.96	4.8	0
like no way you just have a sheriff	7048.36	3.879	1
right now we just talked about this	7049.76	4.24	1
there yeah you'd mentioned clearing out	7052.24	3.201	1
I mean that's the path that they usually	7054.0	3.239	1
do here with the smash they could around	7055.44	4.56	1
the 410 yeah pick it back up and Al just	7057.24	4.681	1
behind 410 to really gain even more	7060.0	3.8	1
space allowing time for them to set up	7061.92	5.199	1
for a full PL out that's why you see	7063.8	6.0	1
zela moving up with the team John C one	7067.12	5.12	1
watching the flank to start the knife to	7069.8	3.72	1
see if loud's going to try to push	7072.24	3.081	1
forward with qck on the Y but he's	7073.52	3.719	1
posted up towards b	7075.32	3.919	1
instead	7077.24	5.281	1
initi so cycling the lock down before	7079.24	5.561	0
the thrash to start things	7082.52	5.44	0
off don't get in my way Les is just	7084.8	6.24	0
trying to get that timing why not yeah	7087.96	6.92	0
he'll be fine back there to run back	7091.04	3.84	1
in PL on the left side though ooh they	7095.2	5.44	1
do get the spray on behind the Cascade	7098.56	4.599	1
so that Spike down remember the thrash	7100.64	4.96	1
is still available for Sashi zela	7103.16	4.48	1
getting some sprays it's the battle	7105.6	4.12	1
inside that pit playing on the	7107.64	3.56	1
extremities of it but with that Spike	7109.72	3.081	1
being down out in the open looks like we	7111.2	3.241	1
have to try to reset for Sentinels it's	7112.8	3.72	1
a thrash to Make Some Noise allowing zel	7114.44	4.04	1
once again to look for a timing on that	7116.52	4.28	1
flank underhand flash being thrown Spike	7118.48	4.96	1
now being picked up as they pull back	7120.8	4.6	1
away from this leaving Z on the top but	7123.44	3.799	1
this whole time as zelus is lurking	7125.4	4.0	1
towards middle that op was always	7127.24	4.521	1
towards that b side and if they don't	7129.4	3.799	1
use the right utility to try to clear it	7131.76	3.6	1
here 30 seconds	7133.2	5.44	0
qck can have some easy picks the lurks	7135.36	5.2	0
or the the rotations have been so late	7138.64	4.321	0
for the last member of loud this time	7140.56	4.48	1
it's going to pay off that's well done	7142.96	4.199	1
here on a positioning from loud because	7145.04	3.88	0
of that op being posted up on the B side	7147.16	3.201	1
they could focus on the kitchen on the	7148.92	3.52	1
rotate down at the under pass even the	7150.36	4.839	1
op gets the pick	7152.44	5.679	1
time all them falling down 5 seconds	7155.2	4.721	1
left actually there is time at this	7158.12	3.761	1
point when T picks it	7159.92	5.44	1
up so two versus two the shorty T still	7161.88	4.68	1
gets the	7165.36	4.16	1
kill but Les now in a clerk situation	7166.56	5.4	1
information where T is at the high low T	7169.52	5.84	1
doesn't even need it oh my gosh how did	7171.96	5.32	1
that happened for senal to be able to	7175.36	3.96	1
convert that round when they dropped	7177.28	4.28	1
that spike in that	7179.32	5.64	1
kitchen it looks	7181.56	3.4	1
impossible qck with the shot it gets to	7186.12	4.04	1
n	7189.0	4.679	1
the just out of range with the shorty as	7190.16	6.761	1
well Sentinels they're kind of just	7193.68	4.761	1
going for it in these moments you know	7196.92	3.44	1
you have no other choice there to plant	7198.44	3.56	0
but to make it happen the positioning	7200.36	4.839	0
counted and loud did not that shorty	7202.0	5.079	1
kill was it right that that pretty much	7205.2	3.52	1
solidifies for the rest to come around	7207.08	4.321	1
and figure out what they need to do want	7208.72	5.36	0
to go quick a flash over the high tide	7211.4	4.16	0
and then a disy towards the front an	7214.08	3.321	0
aggressive push for a Zin almost got	7215.56	3.36	0
that punish onto two East but there's	7217.4	3.56	0
the from out the head on up the sa the	7218.92	4.12	1
spike is down L commen denies also his	7220.96	4.04	1
KN trying to run away towards yellow	7223.04	3.599	1
second pushes forward for the two kills	7225.0	3.52	1
open it up the bide for a bit there's	7226.64	4.121	1
still one player left it's sedak with	7228.52	4.559	1
the B pushing for it gets the kill up to	7230.76	5.72	1
Z who was protecting the spike PL as L	7233.08	6.56	0
gets a nice shot the rotate from behind	7236.48	5.4	0
unfortunately there for cine almost had	7239.64	4.08	0
the opportunity to get the pick it's off	7241.88	4.64	0
to the sheriff alone upgrading now to	7243.72	6.121	1
the Phantom Nur now being used	7246.52	5.48	1
even the turret on the back the orb	7249.84	4.359	1
comes down John cuti swings on the other	7252.0	5.719	1
side and sels have tied up the game just	7254.2	6.601	0
like that three rounds away from being	7257.72	7.561	1
the kings of Na Kings of Americas will	7260.8	7.919	1
they be able to make it happen qck on	7265.28	6.72	1
this yellow has been doing so much work	7268.72	5.241	1
and then Sentinels are snapping back	7272.0	3.639	1
quick they're figuring out what the	7273.96	4.159	1
dangers are in these situations and	7275.64	4.04	1
acting according	7278.12	5.0	1
Z Jersey Finest coming up again laying	7279.68	6.721	1
people down and yeah we are at	7283.12	6.161	1
101 the big difference is Sentinels have	7286.4	5.759	1
two maps under their belt here looking	7289.28	3.919	1
to	7292.16	3.721	1
finalize this Harbor wall again	7293.2	4.761	1
connecting just down long B and then	7295.88	5.0	1
towards viid to slow and delay but	7297.96	5.159	1
Sentinels is happy to do this rounds	7300.88	4.279	1
they move fast they are just going fast	7303.12	4.321	1
off the rip rounds they move slow they	7305.16	4.401	1
get the read they want	7307.44	3.52	1
that's right the job's not done here for	7309.56	3.28	1
Sentinels for loud they're still looking	7310.96	4.04	1
pretty good lots of money an operator	7312.84	4.279	1
out once again for qck towards be made a	7315.0	4.119	1
jump spot from Z but they also have ult	7317.12	4.721	0
to work with for the retake so senel has	7319.12	4.52	0
to continue their due diligence here if	7321.84	3.239	1
they want to try to win this map but	7323.64	4.801	1
loud has been looking for answers so far	7325.08	5.881	0
just to try to close out this map I	7328.44	5.56	0
think that was a Miss zus walks up like	7330.96	7.279	0
that the swing for Miss does get the	7334.0	7.4	1
surprise kill on cine with the contact	7338.24	5.721	1
DIY now being thrown towards the air	7341.4	5.6	1
flash moving forward second dashing	7343.96	5.639	1
up and that lock down comes out	7347.0	4.48	1
prematurely the spray through the	7349.6	4.401	1
Cascade second Falls Theo though is a	7351.48	3.84	1
little bit too far behind I don't think	7354.0	2.96	1
it's going to break it so that rotates	7355.32	3.799	1
the players back zel is again trying to	7356.96	4.84	1
go for that lurk but it gets stopped by	7359.12	4.96	1
qck with the operator it's a reset with	7361.8	4.76	1
only 24 seconds left SEL have no choice	7364.08	4.241	1
but to commit towards the a site but	7366.56	3.039	1
they still have a p to to work with they	7368.32	2.399	1
have to get in they don't have wingman	7369.6	2.681	1
to plant here it's going to take	7370.72	3.681	1
everybody being in sight to cover this	7372.28	4.68	1
10's again taking that Nest	7374.4	4.799	1
position John cuti though not looky to	7376.96	3.759	1
use his pit there you go brings it out	7379.2	3.241	1
towards the screen breaking line of	7380.72	3.561	1
sight for the operator knife even thrown	7382.44	4.48	1
towards the screen spotting three High	7384.28	5.839	1
tight separating the a site allowing L	7386.92	4.679	1
to try to swarm out with the four	7390.12	2.881	1
players they have remaining they have a	7391.6	3.761	1
Cove to work with for the diffuse as	7393.0	4.719	1
well tuis is the one that's going to	7395.36	4.04	1
have to stay alive here to give chances	7397.72	4.88	1
for loud to fight back this round 21 10	7399.4	5.48	1
pushing forward within that pit still	7402.6	4.321	1
working on the other side or loud	7404.88	5.04	0
outside the DI sassy gets to spray T	7406.92	6.96	0
inside the TR come out T gets the third	7409.92	7.52	0
SEL Take the Lead they only need two now	7413.88	6.6	1
what a wall coming out from John cue	7417.44	5.799	1
placed perfectly on the left side of a	7420.48	5.4	1
sight like you said making loud come	7423.24	4.92	1
through they have to take damage they	7425.88	4.44	1
have to worry about he goes back to loud	7428.16	4.121	1
for one Sentinels correct whatever	7430.32	3.799	1
happens and they hit even harder the	7432.28	4.56	1
next time it's it just seems Unstoppable	7434.12	4.56	1
from them right now two rounds away from	7436.84	3.68	1
solidifying	7438.68	5.761	1
this and the walls about to	7440.52	6.679	1
drop back a for loud they're not going	7444.44	4.4	1
to play too much they'll put Less on	7447.2	4.0	0
pipes we know that sheriff is always	7448.84	5.16	0
always good for one but Sentinels	7451.2	4.96	1
they're all voting down this be long and	7454.0	3.52	1
they're making their way towards that	7456.16	3.92	1
yellow again cuz the high tide didn't	7457.52	4.599	1
come early anymore they just tried to	7460.08	4.08	0
really push forward for Sentinels	7462.12	3.681	1
knowing that the harbor is so far away	7464.16	3.761	1
they try to assist in theay even more	7465.8	3.799	1
now it's time for sels to activate their	7467.92	4.319	1
lock down on this attack side to try to	7469.6	6.56	1
get the plant in pushing away loud back	7472.24	5.561	1
towards the window the timing out the	7476.16	3.121	1
flash misses but it still allows for him	7477.8	3.52	1
to push forward a wall comes up from two	7479.28	3.839	0
spring through with the help of sedak	7481.32	4.16	0
dropping t p plant now still activated	7483.12	5.12	1
though as the plant comes down for senos	7485.48	5.159	1
and a diff use attempt for loud a tap on	7488.24	3.88	1
the spike first a swing out towards the	7490.64	3.161	1
yellow it's a one for one J with the	7492.12	3.641	1
head shot of the SAU sake bite on the	7493.8	3.64	1
ground John trying to stay alive pushed	7495.76	4.24	0
away as well by the enemy snake bite	7497.44	4.88	1
Cloud burst up jump towards the air	7500.0	4.719	1
beautifully done here living J with two	7502.32	5.72	1
kills with twoes is still there for the	7504.72	7.321	1
trade loud a bright light there with the	7508.04	5.96	1
individual skill I think something we've	7512.04	3.599	1
been missing with the individuals being	7514.0	4.0	0
able to pop off on their own what a	7515.64	5.52	0
Cascade from twoes to save himself that	7518.0	4.159	0
was	7521.16	4.721	0
insane last second thinking to turn the	7522.16	7.321	1
round right around get sodock the kill	7525.88	5.6	1
that would save him and you can see what	7529.48	5.0	0
it means to loud that was a big one	7531.48	4.84	0
almost being suffocated out of the game	7534.48	3.159	0
if they weren't able to take that round	7536.32	3.359	1
on the Low by so yeah the Low by comes	7537.64	3.761	1
up with a win for loud they get a little	7539.68	4.0	1
more momentum Reckoning is here to deny	7541.4	5.56	1
a take and operator in the hands of qck	7543.68	5.4	1
again they have a bit of extremity	7546.96	3.52	1
control here this is the first time we	7549.08	3.12	1
see two no okay he just goes up for the	7550.48	4.119	1
wall thought he was moving forward loud	7552.2	4.44	1
and alloud fans continue to show that	7554.6	4.761	1
they're still here to	7556.64	6.0	1
fight zelis using a different path and	7559.36	4.92	1
going through the high tide using his	7562.64	4.401	1
orb to try to lurk inside the kitchen	7564.28	4.839	1
Sentinels four players set	7567.04	5.079	1
up slowly moving up	7569.12	5.761	1
here towards the a site I mean they did	7572.12	4.44	1
give their information away the first	7574.88	4.16	1
dizzy that came out so maybe or control	7576.56	3.921	1
could be the play we're one away from	7579.04	4.119	1
getting a thrash out for zasi and	7580.48	5.28	1
Bladestorm and zelis trying to count on	7583.16	4.44	1
that one couldn't capitalize on that	7585.76	4.16	0
pick it's the first time zelus has been	7587.6	3.841	1
kind of the the spearhead of the	7589.92	3.44	1
strategy he's always the last to move	7591.44	4.84	1
giving info a was waiting for zelus to	7593.36	4.759	1
cause the disruption here loud doing a	7596.28	3.68	1
great job at holding their positions and	7598.12	4.361	1
not moving on this one Sentinels cannot	7599.96	4.199	0
find an opening just yet waiting for	7602.48	3.639	0
util to make that a possibility so you	7604.16	3.48	0
see the high tide now being thrown from	7606.12	4.04	1
the generator already crosshairs are set	7607.64	4.241	1
towards that right side now or finally	7610.16	3.56	1
picked up trying to use that thash to	7611.88	3.92	1
create that space But A rightly comes	7613.72	5.081	1
out the AIO cues allows to spam through	7615.8	5.2	0
that wall and get two and it's the same	7618.8	4.08	1
story once again trying to rotate out	7621.0	3.4	1
and where they're rotating to and up on	7622.88	4.08	1
the B side beautiful hold is starting	7624.4	4.4	1
off for loud he's got cement boots over	7626.96	4.48	1
here he just does not leave the	7628.8	6.04	1
sight finds him on the rotation but	7631.44	6.719	1
Spike down 14 seconds left loud gets the	7634.84	5.96	1
laps last pick and the last last so far	7638.16	5.681	1
12 to 11 as they're looking to move this	7640.8	5.16	1
over to B match	7643.84	4.68	1
point oh my gosh you know what I want to	7645.96	5.08	1
see bind I want to see our last map	7648.52	5.84	1
let's go to Five Sentinels calling the	7651.04	5.199	1
time out here so Kaplan can get in the	7654.36	2.839	1
ear of the	7656.24	3.88	1
players chat with zelus and John cue	7657.2	4.681	1
figure out what's	7660.12	3.841	1
happening and	7661.88	4.92	1
Loud really accepting that round well	7663.96	5.279	1
the Cascade	7666.8	5.24	1
and just denying Sentinels hey I think	7669.24	5.641	1
Sentinels understands now that qck is a	7672.04	4.84	1
staple at whatever sight he's at	7674.88	3.759	1
depending on the stret or depending on	7676.88	4.16	1
what they do he'll be at the other sight	7678.64	4.161	1
if they don't hear the op at the current	7681.04	3.84	1
attack so they have to worry they have	7682.8	4.439	1
to figure out a way to push qck	7684.88	4.839	1
off keep up that's a big question for	7687.24	4.32	1
them they have the set up though we seen	7689.72	4.4	0
the dizzy in The Flash before zel up to	7691.56	4.321	0
get the flash towards	7694.12	5.201	0
green but has the angle	7695.88	6.04	0
Flash not does not affect him just	7699.32	3.879	0
waiting the thrash I don't think he even	7701.92	4.4	0
got the information oh what almost felt	7703.2	5.561	0
like that was on him yeah just pulled	7706.32	5.16	1
away from the flick but T picks up the	7708.76	6.839	1
alt orb and also has n Comm in in the	7711.48	6.48	1
ready trying to delay even more a high	7715.6	3.6	1
TI comes out all the way back from	7717.96	3.92	1
Kitchen that's tuis slowing down any	7719.2	4.561	1
type of push that Seno's trying to take	7721.88	4.199	1
towards green after getting that Al	7723.76	6.0	1
anticipating a n Comm in Hit	7726.08	5.08	1
zelis going to start doing a little	7729.76	3.76	1
roaming towards belt as they keep an eye	7731.16	4.92	1
on Mid great choice by loud and how	7733.52	4.52	1
they've rotated this coverage to lean	7736.08	4.881	1
over towards the B site and yeah seeing	7738.04	4.4	1
Saucy you're probably like okay wingman	7740.96	3.84	1
Spike we got it per perfect lot of	7742.44	4.4	1
information there for	7744.8	4.2	1
loud but it's Mind Games look at him	7746.84	3.759	1
rotating back towards the a side they're	7749.0	3.52	1
thinking hey SEL might pull back towards	7750.6	4.401	1
the abling for it the gamble doesn't	7752.52	4.599	1
turn out this time around it worked for	7755.0	4.639	1
at least two Allin	7757.12	4.401	1
but this time sels are pushing forward	7759.64	3.881	1
in the a site this is a very sketchy	7761.52	4.84	1
plan wingman comes out for a plant sedak	7763.52	4.599	1
gets the pick and a second one off to	7766.36	5.12	1
zelus qck with the off kill on to Z not	7768.12	5.721	1
even needed the assist the p on the last	7771.48	5.32	1
one the fall is trouble out us are able	7773.84	5.879	1
to push this into a fourth M They're all	7776.8	4.68	1
playing back to where tens can be tens	7779.72	2.801	1
again it's not a Chet but it's going to	7781.48	3.239	1
be a yoru and you'll see gate crashes	7782.52	4.4	0
that go all the way into attacker spawn	7784.72	3.761	0
possibly with what they're trying trying	7786.92	3.799	0
to cook up and I'm sure loud has seen	7788.48	4.199	0
that I'm sure sedak knows T is going to	7790.72	4.041	0
be trying to Route them at all times	7792.68	4.04	1
they go for a bit of a default here with	7794.76	5.04	1
focus on hookah so far making sure those	7796.72	5.321	1
extremities are not owned by Sentinels	7799.8	5.52	1
right now seems like T is set up to do a	7802.04	5.88	1
flashbang dance yeah exactly while the	7805.32	4.44	1
contact was there from zel's towards of	7807.92	3.679	1
U-Haul but as there's no contact there	7809.76	3.24	1
there is that solo play from the	7811.6	3.241	1
initiator once again but second went	7813.0	4.679	1
through the TP loud still answers back	7814.84	4.12	1
as they have the player advantage in	7817.68	2.92	1
this pistol round 10's trying to gain	7818.96	5.759	1
some more map control up towards short	7820.6	6.841	0
no what it's not supposed to work like	7824.72	4.721	1
that it's almost like bread crumbs on a	7827.44	4.639	1
trail it's like piece of candy oh piece	7829.44	5.119	1
of candy oh my	7832.08	5.401	1
gosh three on three zelus now finally	7834.56	6.12	1
spots the contact in towards this a	7837.48	6.04	1
sight decoy thrown out by tens not being	7840.68	5.44	1
shot out the bait doesn't work here for	7843.52	5.32	1
Lou first one tap on the SP Spike trying	7846.12	4.721	1
to see what the hot hands are going here	7848.84	4.2	1
for the attack trying to delay and deny	7850.84	5.04	1
the flank to happen trying to get a TP	7853.04	4.76	1
but thankfully it's only C that fell the	7855.88	4.44	1
[ __ ] still up they spot SAS on the back	7857.8	5.439	1
stab there's another TP Les re swings	7860.32	6.319	1
picks the pick onto Sashi Z then comes	7863.24	6.201	0
back out and somehow it has become	7866.64	5.44	0
individual Peaks one by one by Sentinels	7869.44	5.159	0
putting T in a clutch situation nice	7872.08	4.841	1
long range there by Les and this is not	7874.6	5.08	1
a good time if you're a Sentinels fan to	7876.92	6.92	1
see less Stern activate loud very happy	7879.68	6.721	0
though Vans you have to know it they	7883.84	6.16	1
have started down on every map last I	7886.4	5.6	1
mean last map we went back and forth and	7890.0	4.76	1
Loud found their ground but this is	7892.0	4.8	1
going to be a nice start for them here	7894.76	3.72	1
as long as sen don't get that second	7896.8	3.399	1
round again as as long as they don't	7898.48	3.4	1
looks like the classic by looks like	7900.2	3.841	0
Sentinels will not be able to formulate	7901.88	4.44	0
that purchase on this one course	7904.04	3.679	0
defensive sign here that you see from	7906.32	3.799	0
Sentinels but no gamble stack it's	7907.72	4.041	0
actually a heavy pressure towards the a	7910.12	3.921	0
side of flash to try to pinch for	7911.76	4.879	1
information coming out from long B just	7914.04	5.079	1
simple orb control putting in the hands	7916.64	4.121	1
of	7919.12	4.52	1
tens looking for this timing already one	7920.76	4.959	1
one flash thrown by sashy so getting a	7923.64	3.761	1
quick peek to see if that was true and	7925.72	3.561	1
they are still pushing	7927.4	4.719	1
up and now just a pressure game but	7929.28	4.68	0
three in	7932.12	4.0	1
showers they're going to leave 10 here	7933.96	3.84	1
for sure and then back up towards the	7936.12	3.161	1
rest of the site now they'll play the	7937.8	3.12	1
site kind of vertically instead of	7939.28	3.839	1
horizontally if U-Haul control is gained	7940.92	4.12	1
they'll just fight loud out of U-Haul as	7943.12	3.48	1
much as they	7945.04	4.639	1
can oh my what a read just holding the	7946.6	5.56	1
whole time and they can hear it too for	7949.68	4.52	1
now right now it's just meeting up here	7952.16	4.48	1
from the spawn a walk contact Z is going	7954.2	5.281	1
to be the first one sees it on the first	7956.64	4.681	1
what a smart Peak T now switching back	7959.48	3.48	1
to right click instead the hot hands	7961.32	4.239	1
being thrown it's	7962.96	6.0	1
clear it's allows L to split the a site	7965.56	6.64	1
smokes all abundance inside a within the	7968.96	7.32	1
smokes qck gets the execution onto zelus	7972.2	5.44	1
there's still players there though all	7976.28	3.959	1
of Cals have rotated towards the a side	7977.64	4.241	1
trying to do at least some sort of	7980.24	4.761	1
damage that's John cue with two but with	7981.88	5.359	1
that round here you'll have the run it	7985.0	4.8	1
back activated for QC in their bonus	7987.24	5.801	1
round and Loud even with these two	7989.8	6.359	1
rounds look like they're in so much more	7993.04	5.28	0
of a Groove they have the read on	7996.16	4.4	1
Sentinels they know ten is going to be	7998.32	5.399	1
somewhere ratty trying to be funky on	8000.56	6.881	0
the yoru instant Peak Z did not pull	8003.72	6.161	0
their attention away they are ready for	8007.44	3.96	1
the tricks that Sentinels will bring to	8009.88	4.319	1
the table here all right onto the next	8011.4	5.239	1
one loud look pick up this bonus would	8014.2	5.121	1
be gigantic especially on the Low by	8016.64	4.801	1
they're forced into here due to some	8019.32	4.96	0
deaths n wanted some showers control out	8021.44	5.08	0
for loud Camp they did	8024.28	5.04	0
it convert in that second round from the	8026.52	5.32	0
pistol now the bonus pressure came	8029.32	4.48	0
towards this bside knife was being	8031.84	3.52	1
thrown to get some information towards	8033.8	4.48	1
the garden SEL still able to play a four	8035.36	5.04	1
position inside hooka though a TP across	8038.28	3.2	0
once	8040.4	3.719	1
again s by being thrown a one for one	8041.48	5.52	1
Surprise Play actually it's a win here	8044.12	4.681	1
for loud cuz they could upgrade a weapon	8047.0	3.96	0
left behind by	8048.8	5.279	1
zeen underhead flash John K's fully	8050.96	5.36	1
blinded but stays in the	8054.08	4.441	1
Smoke easy out	8056.32	5.399	1
there loud continues to pressure at	8058.52	4.36	1
hookah	8061.72	3.48	1
area T now if you look at the mini map	8062.88	4.48	1
throws this Gate Crash again goes all	8065.2	4.04	1
the way to spawn and'll have a rotation	8067.36	4.64	1
around the side of loud if it comes to	8069.24	5.761	1
it weak great shot by cenen still a	8072.0	5.639	1
great opener then the Wall comes up on	8075.0	4.76	1
defense keeping J CD alive was important	8077.64	3.321	0
here so they could spray across for	8079.76	3.52	0
these two kills now it doesn't really	8080.96	5.599	1
matter on this TP a flash moving forward	8083.28	5.359	1
allowing sels to push up get the wall	8086.56	5.56	1
bang onto seds Che all alone Vandal in	8088.64	5.721	1
hand 26 seconds left so he's got time to	8092.12	6.04	1
work with the first shot now shows that	8094.36	5.64	1
he did try to look for some cover	8098.16	4.161	1
Through The Brimstone smoke yeah John	8100.0	4.92	1
CYT just winning on the other side	8102.32	5.759	1
letting Sashi be the first Contact oh	8104.92	5.96	0
there's the back stab oh with the third	8108.08	5.201	0
almost saw that coming my	8110.88	5.0	0
gosh somehow the positioning of tens	8113.28	5.24	0
could have been costly there	8115.88	4.6	1
as it seems as though sashy thought that	8118.52	4.92	1
he had his back but thankfully John cue	8120.48	5.159	1
was there for the save tu's putting a	8123.44	5.52	1
scare Factor on that round for Sentinels	8125.64	5.92	1
a 3v one and we almost saw him go down	8128.96	5.08	1
one by one one enemy remaining and look	8131.56	4.52	1
at that replay you just saw the last two	8134.04	5.0	1
times that second went for pain shells	8136.08	5.201	1
to open the door sneak by towards that	8139.04	5.92	0
front so they do have a a heavy pressure	8141.28	5.72	0
set up to try to really get some players	8144.96	4.04	1
vulnerable and line up some kills they	8147.0	4.04	1
love teleporters too oh it starts off	8149.0	4.119	0
right away it was just saying both zelus	8151.04	4.44	1
and Z have used the teleporter now even	8153.12	3.96	0
with that util as we have a first shower	8155.48	3.52	1
hit and it's not going to stop TR Blazer	8157.08	4.52	1
trying to bait out the player is	8159.0	5.199	1
focusing on that dog so that Zin could	8161.6	4.921	1
try to swing out again for the pick but	8164.2	4.4	1
everything calms down now	8166.52	5.92	1
yeah man that was quick both players	8168.6	6.0	1
realizing it was uh both teams it was	8172.44	4.56	1
just attempt at showers to see how how	8174.6	4.361	1
deep they would go	8177.0	4.92	1
now back towards mid switched up a few	8178.96	5.44	1
times Ela up top good timing on that one	8181.92	6.159	1
from coward Zen saw the shoulder as Elsa	8184.4	6.08	0
gets the pick Leo walks through his own	8188.08	5.001	0
orb to answer right back with the second	8190.48	5.839	1
one to avenge his teammate on top of	8193.08	5.359	1
that giving it Advantage for loud on the	8196.32	5.441	1
pulse PL snake bite even misses	8198.44	5.0	1
y	8201.76	4.28	1
holding and they knowing Viper there	8203.44	4.08	1
only have to look for the flank now cuz	8206.04	4.359	1
they going to have shower control loud	8207.52	4.92	1
really cleanly Gathering these rounds	8210.4	3.92	1
especially after that shower we see	8212.44	4.641	1
sadak recalling the hit toward short	8214.32	5.36	1
loud seems on point for these strats now	8217.08	4.08	1
and they take back a gun round after	8219.68	3.521	1
that Bonus Goes the way of Sentinels	8221.16	3.8	1
just the last few shots here and	8223.2	3.72	1
preventative utility to shut out	8224.96	3.759	1
Sentinels gambled the sake bites here	8226.92	4.12	1
just flush out some positions but loud	8228.72	4.92	1
doubled up and U-Haul one towards	8231.04	4.12	1
showers and they have their own utility	8233.64	3.641	1
for the P SP as well not looking good at	8235.16	5.0	1
all spray comes across stays alive at 6	8237.28	5.72	1
hp but at the end of the day it still	8240.16	4.72	1
loud's	8243.0	5.04	1
round they go 3-1	8244.88	6.96	1
up the attack from L it's it seems like	8248.04	5.92	1
they're moving quick enough but also	8251.84	5.36	1
taking care of the extremities loud is	8253.96	5.96	1
that t isn't getting to use the yoru	8257.2	4.279	1
like we saw in the last bind game from	8259.92	4.36	1
Sentinels it was much more destructive	8261.48	4.601	1
much more distracting to the opponent	8264.28	4.239	1
here and you know what I say that and we	8266.08	3.96	1
might get it out of a dimensional drift	8268.52	3.16	1
here if he starts getting in the brains	8270.04	4.24	1
of loud trying to Ping him out for this	8271.68	5.201	1
strategy running back can happen just as	8274.28	4.6	1
well with that ultimate from Brimstone	8276.88	3.599	1
in the orbital strike so they may just	8278.88	3.96	1
microwave U-Haul here once they get the	8280.48	4.601	1
chance might be difficult one here as	8282.84	4.12	1
they have a low by for Sentinels on that	8285.08	4.2	1
end though doubling up towards the boxes	8286.96	3.639	1
at the short	8289.28	4.72	1
a loud already just held back by that	8290.6	5.401	1
smoke that was dropped on the defensive	8294.0	4.88	1
side that being here by zelus ready to	8296.0	5.8	1
gate crash out of a	8298.88	2.92	0
shot it's being quiet right here they	8302.8	4.28	0
they tried to play the contact after	8305.08	4.92	0
that smoke knowing the position lik to	8307.08	5.359	1
play on they'll use a run it back to	8310.0	4.8	1
even confirm that the main default	8312.44	5.92	1
position of the aite is open spotting	8314.8	6.32	1
zelus at triple utility being used out	8318.36	4.641	1
here on both ends deniability from snake	8321.12	3.64	1
bites all the way out from the be site	8323.0	4.679	1
landing at the default spot preventing a	8324.76	5.36	1
from coming down also making sure that	8327.68	3.8	1
the smokes could dissipate but the	8330.12	3.319	1
second smoke comes down another tap	8331.48	4.321	1
utility baiting out zel is trying to get	8333.44	4.2	1
some right clicks everybody's hiding in	8335.8	3.919	1
the thick of the spark but there's that	8337.64	4.561	1
first Blood finally inside the a site as	8339.72	4.561	1
Q moves forward now being pressured by	8342.2	4.04	0
zel's right click classic coming	8344.28	3.96	1
through that's really going to SL the	8346.24	3.72	1
bleeding after this loud is in a	8348.24	3.88	1
beautiful setup towards the end better	8349.96	4.559	0
Weaponry last player standing even	8352.12	5.04	0
better health so much more confidence	8354.52	4.761	1
coming out of these loud strategies we	8357.16	5.159	1
just saw loud tempt the plant without	8359.28	5.68	1
having showers control knowing how much	8362.32	4.841	1
it would RI up send they only had a	8364.96	3.96	0
smoke covering shower that doesn't	8367.16	3.199	0
prevent anything they were accepting	8368.92	2.759	0
mollies they were getting shot while	8370.36	3.881	0
planning loud wanted to take that fight	8371.68	5.04	0
and qck as you said pushing through to	8374.24	5.76	0
break that defensive smoke absolutely	8376.72	6.441	0
threw sen off nicely done here by loud	8380.0	5.559	1
to get another round secured they do it	8383.16	3.8	1
differently too giving sen a different	8385.56	3.641	1
look to work work with John C is going	8386.96	4.0	1
to have Al for next round but loud's	8389.2	3.4	1
feeling good on the momentum and they'll	8390.96	4.479	1
have Cowen Zen probably on Al along with	8392.6	5.36	1
tuis so we'll see this again once once	8395.44	4.841	1
qck got to that right side it caused a	8397.96	3.2	0
lot of	8400.28	3.96	0
trouble and then it was just hunting	8401.16	5.44	1
after that with blood in the water yeah	8404.24	3.68	1
thankfully those silver letting for	8406.6	2.879	1
Sentinels the Phantom that they save in	8407.92	3.24	1
a previous round became the Phantom they	8409.48	4.161	1
save into this round and also on top of	8411.16	4.76	1
that the economy has been built up also	8413.64	4.679	0
in the ult economy that he could now	8415.92	3.96	0
finally maybe start using that	8418.32	2.641	0
dimensional	8419.88	4.559	0
drift are moving up here for information	8420.96	5.399	0
and control T positioning all the way	8424.44	4.201	0
towards the left side as well and could	8426.36	5.12	0
TP instantly towards the a site should L	8428.64	5.56	0
try to pressure in the pit the John cuti	8431.48	5.681	0
just plays down towards	8434.2	2.96	0
mid Saucy look at me not at T oh the	8437.32	7.481	0
spam through the bottom left corner and	8442.16	5.239	0
a punish as T was looking for a Hero	8444.8	3.88	0
play to trade her right back and maybe	8447.4	4.401	1
TP away so that's two players falling	8448.68	5.08	1
down sashy alone on the anchor towards	8451.8	4.48	1
the back of the	8453.76	2.52	1
site it's again the 1 V one prowess	8456.68	5.4	1
right now that loud's able to hit	8459.72	4.48	1
Sentinels isn't finding these kills from	8462.08	4.2	1
tens or just the members trying to do	8464.2	3.76	1
their own little excursions here like	8466.28	3.32	1
they were on previous maps of this	8467.96	5.359	1
series loud is tightening everything up	8469.6	5.2	1
it looks like they could get this entry	8473.32	4.281	1
into B to count as well s's been good	8474.8	4.559	1
anchoring the back of the aide of split	8477.6	3.56	1
can do it this time around on B no looks	8479.36	3.641	1
like the fall line the side of it just	8481.16	5.199	0
hit him and Sak's able to punish him for	8483.0	5.72	0
trying to Anchor solo and do the hero	8486.36	4.761	1
play last two guys will most likely save	8488.72	4.36	1
at this	8491.12	5.16	1
point and they still have Cowen Zen's	8493.08	5.76	1
alt after the frags on this round	8496.28	4.92	1
they've been cycling so well here to get	8498.84	4.08	1
themselves in the sight sodx is going to	8501.2	4.239	1
be coming up soon I think these next	8502.92	5.12	1
rounds van silly uh if maybe even a	8505.44	5.201	1
timeout of for how Sentinels are going	8508.04	4.92	1
to use this showstopper is it is it to	8510.64	4.799	0
put pressure on and z and tens are are	8512.96	4.12	0
activated right are they going to use it	8515.44	3.401	1
for a retake because right now the	8517.08	5.0	0
retakes do not seem like their Sentinels	8518.84	5.08	1
doesn't have enough room to get the	8522.08	4.399	0
retake they want I should say so that's	8523.92	5.0	0
going to be a question how is this	8526.48	3.92	1
showstopper going to turn it around for	8528.92	3.76	1
sun it's definitely hard to get the room	8530.4	4.641	0
or to retake when you're losing players	8532.68	4.6	0
in the process of what loud is currently	8535.04	4.56	1
doing and really picking players apart	8537.28	4.76	1
in their positioning Within These sights	8539.6	4.16	0
so yeah you might come down to those	8542.04	4.04	1
plays where you have such a low buy	8543.76	3.96	1
right now for Sentinels it could be a	8546.08	3.96	1
potential just half buy with rifles and	8547.72	4.56	1
you have to do that hero play potential	8550.04	4.48	1
with the hey let's Hail Mary towards	8552.28	4.24	1
short the amount of times here that	8554.52	3.879	1
Sentinels or should I say loud try to	8556.52	3.76	1
contact up towards short and really try	8558.4	3.96	1
to execute through the brimstone smokes	8560.28	3.36	1
it could be one of those hey let's try	8562.36	3.481	1
to flash let's try to showstop her get	8563.64	3.92	1
one for trouble second hopefully your	8565.84	2.96	1
Rocket's going to get two or something	8567.56	3.2	1
like	8568.8	5.679	1
that or short a I should say let's get	8570.76	5.36	1
this started the fans are ready time	8574.48	3.681	1
out's over and we're back on to bind	8576.12	5.12	1
here 5-1 loud looking to bring us to a	8578.16	4.52	1
map five with the momentum they	8581.24	5.8	1
currently have let's do it Vance zela	8582.68	5.799	1
taking control of shower so there's no	8587.04	3.68	1
early smoke moving out towards the	8588.48	4.801	0
extremities of short a looks like we had	8590.72	4.24	0
a nice flash that came out from sedak	8593.28	2.8	0
though on the top of the palm tree	8594.96	3.08	1
blinding two players gets the pick on to	8596.08	4.6	1
10 not allowing Z to really move forward	8598.04	5.0	1
with the showstar per Satchel from the	8600.68	5.96	0
APC beautifully done here by the IGA	8603.04	6.12	0
sedak off this timeout anticipating some	8606.64	4.2	0
sort of pressure towards short and that	8609.16	4.279	0
flash was	8610.84	5.2	0
everything walk forward the first	8613.44	5.561	0
Contact in the continuous kills out of	8616.04	5.76	1
Sentinels Spike down at the same time	8619.0	5.84	1
Seekers coming out now know that sedak	8621.8	5.639	0
now pivoted across short toward towards	8624.84	3.479	0
the	8627.44	3.201	1
Sands while his teammates beting up with	8628.32	4.641	1
him here in the back of the	8630.64	4.679	1
fountain so look at Sentinels how do	8632.96	3.56	1
they want to Pip this they keep it	8635.32	4.04	1
towards a 2 two re gaining control	8636.52	4.799	1
towards hookah so they can spray on one	8639.36	5.641	0
side they' flow TPS towards the a site	8641.32	5.16	0
you have two players pushed up in their	8645.0	4.52	0
area to watch that as well slow movement	8646.48	5.521	1
through octagon they have to tempt	8649.52	5.08	1
everything here hoping to find either	8652.0	5.68	1
util or that	8654.6	4.839	1
and it's only it's it's Buddy system	8657.68	5.4	1
right now right movement from John C and	8659.44	5.681	1
sashy they will not part from each other	8663.08	4.04	1
just the flank watch on the other side	8665.12	3.159	1
and then they collapse once they know	8667.12	3.08	1
the spike is down here but right now zel	8668.28	5.2	1
is in range here if it did come a moment	8670.2	4.96	1
where these players fell down towards	8673.48	5.321	0
long B they had the oral strike so time	8675.16	6.0	0
was pressur for allow and it did not	8678.8	4.72	0
take advantage of the time left for sure	8681.16	5.6	1
allowed 5 to2 now as s pick up another	8683.52	4.32	1
round	8686.76	3.0	1
and just a note let's be sure we're	8687.84	4.08	1
cheering for the results not the buildup	8689.76	4.92	1
to the result to keep these players in	8691.92	4.479	1
the mode they need to be in and focused	8694.68	3.599	1
on just the	8696.4	4.681	1
kills good push good play sen come up	8698.28	4.401	1
with another round and now it's going to	8701.08	4.199	1
be three to three on these big time	8702.68	4.4	1
ultimates that that guy is definitely	8705.28	3.841	1
not smiling he is not smiling right now	8707.08	3.88	1
they're having trouble finding a way to	8709.12	3.72	1
break that smile we saw the other guys	8710.96	4.519	1
too noting	8712.84	5.8	1
it all right three towards a here and	8715.48	5.761	1
the split still from loud to prepare	8718.64	4.48	1
themselves for a push tens hasn't been	8721.24	3.68	1
able to get as much space as he did last	8723.12	3.159	1
time I know he keeps saying that but	8724.92	5.04	1
they're really really cutting him	8726.28	3.681	1
close it's 10's close range with the TP	8730.68	6.4	1
Z first Contact once again there's that	8734.44	4.321	1
jump spot tens is getting ready for the	8737.08	3.04	1
left side if there's going to be a	8738.76	3.88	1
rewing Les setting out for an orb late	8740.12	4.84	1
towards	8742.64	2.32	1
U-Haul already activates it up but this	8745.48	4.721	1
is going to be good information here for	8748.88	2.76	1
Sentinels cuz nobody's really moving	8750.2	3.0	1
behind even the boombot to try to bait	8751.64	4.4	1
it out Willow be ready for the position	8753.2	4.6	1
of where T is at at the corner when the	8756.04	5.64	1
TP is also gone 10 now in a position of	8757.8	7.639	1
a one and done well lder looking to	8761.68	5.4	1
activate with the N command towards the	8765.44	5.081	1
a site full execution coming	8767.08	5.64	1
through hands around the corner there's	8770.52	5.839	0
that first shot Les falls down Q also	8772.72	7.12	0
heavily as try to move out towards the	8776.36	5.92	0
showers and off to run it back two	8779.84	4.559	0
players instantly fall for Sentinels	8782.28	4.08	0
trying to delay trying to deny is the	8784.4	4.321	0
old strike coming down from zelus at 1	8786.36	4.881	0
HP off the PCH allowing the flank to	8788.72	3.559	1
happen from	8791.24	3.84	1
Sashi now in more delays there's 15	8792.28	4.921	1
seconds left Q decides to push forward	8795.08	4.16	1
and they flip the sight loud is now	8797.2	4.52	1
planning for spawn while they had the	8799.24	5.079	1
Rolling Thunder to work with look at	8801.72	4.92	1
that position you saw that KUSI ran	8804.32	4.281	1
through through the get position toward	8806.64	3.839	1
showers so this is looking really good	8808.6	3.6	1
for L on a pulse	8810.48	4.681	1
PL moving in not too much util there the	8812.2	4.44	1
heels are already been	8815.16	4.84	1
had Q nobody's going to focus on this no	8816.64	7.52	1
way gets it 3K for qk remember the	8820.0	6.279	1
ultimate was just used recently halfway	8824.16	4.72	1
there already can really start to flex	8826.28	4.401	1
into the sight and they get that	8828.88	4.04	1
ultimate out of Cowen Zine finally to	8830.68	4.48	1
make it work been holding on to that	8832.92	4.479	1
just to make sure it was right and they	8835.16	5.8	1
do collect the W 6 to2	8837.4	6.441	1
now loud starting to show a lot of	8840.96	5.16	1
confidence that we were looking for in	8843.84	5.519	1
the first two maps where do they	8846.12	6.359	1
go just a split to the right side sadak	8849.36	4.881	1
is going to be the one who is on the	8852.48	3.92	1
lurk as per usual this is the way we	8854.24	4.44	1
usually see it when SED Do's on the sky	8856.4	3.561	1
when he's on something that can info	8858.68	2.799	1
detect here he'll still be able to do it	8859.96	4.439	1
a bit with a knife and just his	8861.48	5.88	1
eyeballs slow push from t	8864.4	5.92	1
and Sentinels playing more receptive now	8867.36	4.641	1
to what loud is trying to put onto the	8870.32	2.801	0
map they aren't getting these	8872.0	3.6	0
extremities checked as much hooka seems	8873.12	5.8	0
to be very important for loud to one to	8875.6	4.92	0
get that to get John cue but they've	8878.92	3.68	0
tempted it a lot they Faultline it a lot	8880.52	4.08	0
just to mess with hookah exactly it	8882.6	3.0	0
seems as though it was something that	8884.6	2.6	1
SEL was trying to read on the game plan	8885.6	3.2	1
but we hold that thought SEL after	8887.2	4.0	1
losing a player trying to gain some more	8888.8	4.88	1
control information by contacting down	8891.2	5.96	1
towards long be and now they jump spot	8893.68	5.16	1
actually just a quick jiggle from Ze to	8897.16	3.4	1
see the other two they're going to have	8898.84	4.76	1
to Turtle back into B	8900.56	3.04	0
site but yeah looking at how loud likes	8904.2	5.48	0
to pressure towards hookah but the first	8908.04	4.239	0
few rounds they haven't done it SEL	8909.68	4.24	1
realized okay we can do the Trap plays	8912.28	4.401	1
with the TPS now so they let it go and	8913.92	4.439	1
it allows loud in round number nine to	8916.68	2.88	1
actually do that execution to get the	8918.36	3.361	1
pick but not before now the execution	8919.56	3.839	1
towards the aide the show stopper out	8921.72	3.88	1
from Z landing on the	8923.4	4.161	1
cow	8925.6	4.36	1
though once again doing some hero plays	8927.56	4.48	1
just inside that smoke as T walking	8929.96	3.88	1
through gets the execution traded out by	8932.04	4.239	1
zelus that showers running through the	8933.84	5.32	1
Molly Z gets the backstab on to Les Tu	8936.28	5.561	1
is now lone with the swipe down zelis	8939.16	5.199	1
with a drive by once again in the	8941.84	5.559	1
stier they're trading 3ks that's what it	8944.36	6.521	1
takes two 3ks in a row for qck and it's	8947.4	6.481	1
not going to be enough Sentinels still	8950.88	4.96	1
find a way through that was the Stinger	8953.88	4.88	1
swing as well from zelus some say he's	8955.84	4.0	1
still	8958.76	4.679	1
swinging wow dimensional drift is there	8959.84	5.0	1
for the next round we'll see this play	8963.44	3.201	1
once again just up in the face their	8964.84	3.72	1
opponent celus with a quick pen there to	8966.64	5.36	1
get the frag knowing it would come	8968.56	3.44	1
through Fearless play	8972.76	4.04	1
here we're going to have weapons on both	8976.92	4.04	1
sides exactly you saw from that replay	8979.04	4.239	1
after Kus got that pick on to 10 running	8980.96	4.359	1
back is available in round number	8983.28	5.561	1
10 last now looking really good on the	8985.32	5.841	1
attack haven't been fully figured out	8988.84	3.2	1
here by	8991.16	3.199	1
Sentinels as of	8992.04	4.92	1
yet as they're looking	8994.36	5.361	1
for the contact now toward short I think	8996.96	4.319	1
that was through smoke zelus Falls	8999.72	3.28	1
running back once	9001.28	3.881	1
again after the first kill to try to	9003.0	4.319	1
clear it out now they spot Zin on the	9005.16	4.72	1
right side of showers even utility	9007.32	4.96	1
pushes all the way back should allow the	9009.88	4.64	1
plant to come down though looking all	9012.28	4.241	1
the way back from the spawn here's a TP	9014.52	4.36	1
SE a TP and does a little bit of damage	9016.52	4.04	1
there onto	9018.88	3.519	1
sasi and he's going to be in position	9020.56	3.839	1
for the mly too so the post plant was	9022.4	4.561	1
the lurk dimensional drift inside U-Haul	9024.4	3.681	1
T is going to call out their three	9026.96	2.439	1
players in there after the shot for the	9028.08	2.96	1
nine they diffus but it's going to	9029.4	4.281	1
halfway hit by that one Bal then comes	9031.04	4.08	0
down for the Post Pline less with the	9033.68	4.24	1
shorty on the S as more flashes coming	9035.12	4.68	1
through but it's looking pretty good	9037.92	3.76	1
here for L on the pulse so far more	9039.8	5.519	1
shorty action oh my God the short things	9041.68	5.799	1
come out for loud they take the lead by	9045.32	4.08	1
four or they maintain the lead by four	9047.48	5.8	1
so far yeah cine there with his own 3K	9049.4	7.321	1
great play by loud loud starting to	9053.28	5.481	1
figure out the map to where they don't	9056.72	5.28	1
need their full Squad to get in so much	9058.76	5.28	1
different from the previous maps in this	9062.0	4.16	1
series you have tu's all the way back	9064.04	3.84	1
watching flank you still had less at	9066.16	3.76	1
Short a who didn't have to get into the	9067.88	4.0	1
fight until a little bit to when the	9069.92	5.439	1
spike was half really good patience and	9071.88	6.08	1
control here by what loud is doing once	9075.36	4.12	1
they're inside the site like I said	9077.96	3.28	0
they're doing it with even less numbers	9079.48	4.441	0
now cuz they're making it work so well	9081.24	4.96	1
so quick Molly or quick orb over that's	9083.92	4.16	1
going to land just about the spot right	9086.2	3.04	1
uh left to the wall so that's going to	9088.08	4.199	1
be a U-Haul orb I can make sure that	9089.24	5.52	1
wall doesn't leave them open once they	9092.28	5.08	1
get past it showers control this time	9094.76	5.0	1
and cine First	9097.36	5.401	1
Blood easy one so far I mean he used a	9099.76	5.0	1
lot of utility to really flush out early	9102.76	3.84	1
aggression knowing that sel's on the L	9104.76	3.84	1
by we're going to try to do something	9106.6	3.28	1
aggressive but the aggression came out	9108.6	3.719	1
from long b instead is always ready for	9109.88	6.36	1
these place in the last one oh	9112.32	6.441	1
clean look that three k is around one	9116.24	4.88	1
for everybody it's like a prize right	9118.76	8.32	1
now collected by loud in handfuls here	9121.12	8.76	1
tuis Al back up they're going to be able	9127.08	4.52	1
to figure out whatever they want for	9129.88	4.24	1
final round but they will receive three	9131.6	4.759	1
ultimates here from the side of Sentinel	9134.12	3.88	1
one enemy remaining if they don't go	9136.36	3.481	1
down on that first	9138.0	5.68	1
Blood loud went from slow playing kind	9139.84	6.519	1
of to the extremities to that round was	9143.68	4.799	1
cenen walking up showers to contact and	9146.36	4.481	0
just frag somebody like they're they're	9148.48	4.321	1
using it all right now and they're not	9150.84	4.559	1
try they're trying to keep a precedent	9152.8	4.12	1
out of sentinel's head they're not	9155.4	3.321	1
showing the same thing loud keeps	9156.92	4.439	1
switching it up and Sen keeps guessing	9158.72	3.88	1
well they're guessing right this time	9161.36	3.92	1
around Sadat solo into showers but he	9162.6	5.24	1
still gets one before before he falls	9165.28	4.641	1
and's going to pull some players across	9167.84	4.36	1
Seekers coming out confirming now that	9169.92	4.72	0
hook control finally comes out for	9172.2	6.04	0
loud ult from John cue preventing a	9174.64	5.96	0
split from happening aggressively for	9178.24	4.239	0
the attack side as	9180.6	4.28	0
well because they lost the	9182.48	4.281	0
do can't really push through they're	9184.88	3.24	1
going to use the orbital strike in set	9186.76	3.36	1
beautiful utility that spray right in	9188.12	4.48	1
between what a play there for L to take	9190.12	5.04	1
control of B	9192.6	4.96	1
Main	9195.16	5.0	1
slow okay that's heard by sashy at least	9197.56	6.32	1
but does Z move this is great ground to	9200.16	7.159	1
be gained by loud loud right now just to	9203.88	6.479	1
enter towards the sight sashy splits out	9207.32	6.12	1
the push and that's a spike down but qk	9210.36	4.481	1
was still there inside hook could to tra	9213.44	5.561	1
her right out zelis trying to count the	9214.84	5.439	1
timing to get through the smoke as it	9219.0	3.6	1
dissipates he's able to fall	9220.28	4.521	1
away you talked about second anchoring	9222.6	5.32	1
for the longest time TP true and now you	9224.8	5.2	1
understand when La T takes control of	9227.92	4.439	1
hookah it's so hard to deal against for	9230.0	3.84	1
the retake	9232.36	4.241	1
exactly even if you have B main control	9233.84	4.599	1
in the Octagon Garden it doesn't seem	9236.6	3.6	1
like it matters with what loud is going	9238.44	3.441	1
to start doing to push and pull you	9240.2	3.64	1
around that hookah around the market	9241.88	3.88	1
side of the map and maybe even showers	9243.84	4.72	1
cuz their numbers are working so	9245.76	4.96	1
efficiently in groups of three or four	9248.56	5.16	1
with that lurker still around the map	9250.72	5.52	1
very well done so far here by loud and	9253.72	5.28	0
93 hopefully could be a 93 curse for the	9256.24	5.36	0
SOS fans but until we start the second	9259.0	4.8	0
half let's toss it down to GB people	9261.6	4.56	0
dancing on the VCT America Stage that's	9263.8	4.16	1
all you need to get out of that awesome	9266.16	4.48	1
stuff by the two from the crowd love the	9267.96	4.76	1
Showmanship thanks so much for for	9270.64	3.88	1
coming out and making that so awesome so	9272.72	3.84	1
even if the loud fan won on push-ups the	9274.52	3.759	1
crowd was still behind to see who won	9276.56	3.4	1
for the series so I think it's still	9278.28	3.801	1
even out we don't know who's going to	9279.96	4.28	1
win this series yet so we'll just let	9282.08	5.08	1
the game decide in the piss around now	9284.24	5.8	1
Sentinels on the attack working out very	9287.16	5.159	1
slow contact to start things off at	9290.04	4.6	1
their default again you're seen the same	9292.32	4.12	1
thing though jump contacts coming out	9294.64	4.08	1
from L and getting ready to delay deny	9296.44	4.481	1
with Cen Zen theault line set up at the	9298.72	4.52	1
elbow but it sides otherwise to Pivot	9300.92	4.439	1
towards the a site and it's a great read	9303.24	3.44	1
so far cuz that's where sentinel's	9305.36	3.681	1
moving as well they are encroaching back	9306.68	4.599	1
to the other side of the map if you get	9309.04	4.48	1
that kill over towards B long G Crash	9311.28	4.281	1
from 10 everybody's hitting the site but	9313.52	4.68	1
they go back back to strp B of round one	9315.56	4.52	1
that's going to be the a hit not enough	9318.2	3.84	1
noise at B long so we go for short the	9320.08	4.88	1
Molly from Z now but loud ready on the	9322.04	4.56	1
other side for this as the smoke start	9324.96	4.479	1
to clear and with the orb to use the dog	9326.6	4.32	1
but it's towards the right side to allow	9329.44	3.681	1
T to move forward inside showers and	9330.92	4.32	1
both twinsies are working together on	9333.12	3.88	1
the left side of triple the right click	9335.24	4.039	0
classic SLE Score first in the pistol	9337.0	5.0	0
round sadak Falls and there's traits	9339.28	5.241	1
instantly all around the Spike's still	9342.0	5.6	1
down 30 seconds left delayed enough for	9344.52	5.0	1
potential backstab coming through as two	9347.6	3.52	1
just got spotted they saw one will they	9349.52	4.959	1
see two beautiful Flash coming out from	9351.12	6.319	1
10 but they	9354.48	2.96	1
both quick heal comes down to to John	9358.72	7.679	1
cue left side of triple gas down wall	9362.92	5.76	1
down as well pivot back from loud using	9366.4	4.721	1
all the time in their favor oh the head	9368.68	5.679	1
shot down to 8 HP just to try to delay	9371.12	5.56	1
so two is come come out of shower gets	9374.36	4.08	1
that pick and there's the	9376.68	4.24	1
trade beautifully done in a coordination	9378.44	5.601	1
of loud they come out for the trade and	9380.92	6.12	1
two will get the diffuse loud now or at	9384.04	5.08	1
10 and they're really trying to push	9387.04	5.52	0
this to the brink in that five to go to	9389.12	6.56	0
Lotus between these two teams as well	9392.56	4.919	0
one of the biggest chess games you can	9395.68	5.12	0
run on our three site Maps cannot wait	9397.48	5.721	1
cannot wait it looks like it is on the	9400.8	4.8	1
horizon a stinger by here from Sentinels	9403.2	5.44	1
we saw saw this be effective on ice box	9405.6	6.48	1
Can it have the same result here on bind	9408.64	5.679	1
loud has just been so strong Guardian in	9412.08	3.92	1
the hands of tu's after those frags and	9414.32	5.16	1
the defuse building himself up to alt	9416.0	5.84	1
stingers and Bulldogs around with Sak's	9419.48	6.161	1
judge close in hand guarding U-Haul all	9421.84	5.96	0
right so send flip it 10's now on the	9425.64	4.32	1
left side of the map to Gate Crash back	9427.8	3.84	1
to the right so a little bit different	9429.96	4.92	1
from round one but loud has no reason to	9431.64	5.4	1
really worri about any anything until	9434.88	3.76	0
Sentinels puts their full their full	9437.04	4.88	0
force into a sight hit trying to move	9438.64	5.24	0
quickly try to Pivot some players out	9441.92	4.8	0
the knife came out from shorty into s	9443.88	4.68	0
and with that it allows for L to just	9446.72	3.84	0
hold back for a bit but he do have	9448.56	4.24	1
players to try to work for utility soak	9450.56	4.48	1
holding as judge and SEL definitely know	9452.8	4.0	1
that tape so everybody's pitting towards	9455.04	3.88	1
the right side of ABC to try to get the	9456.8	4.36	1
backstab zel has just got spotted Molly	9458.92	4.96	1
to Molly lass to that now Pinn inside	9461.16	4.92	1
but the judge gets the kill second train	9463.88	4.64	1
right back with the Stingers Advantage	9466.08	4.04	1
for sels as they get the plat down	9468.52	4.2	1
towards the a	9470.12	2.6	1
site rotate	9472.88	4.64	1
around going be a little too late here	9475.44	4.761	1
for qck with the damage that Z's doing	9477.52	5.2	1
with the judge as he flies through sight	9480.2	4.159	1
picks up the Stinger once again after	9482.72	3.88	1
that damage has been done yeah loud got	9484.36	3.96	1
a piece of their own	9486.6	4.36	1
medicine T also winning that fight the	9488.32	5.361	1
Stinger meta has it	9490.96	5.96	1
returned one more to go it's UC K denied	9493.68	7.36	1
by zelis off the trade to again they do	9496.92	6.16	1
it again this is amazing seeing a	9501.04	3.84	1
stinger meta coming back from the	9503.08	3.68	1
Sentinels that's Kaplan at the helm	9504.88	3.519	1
pretty much he is the one that brought	9506.76	4.24	1
that up back in the day in like	9508.4	5.04	1
2021 what was a team name like Echo 7 or	9511.0	4.439	1
something with Rob whiz oh wow oh yeah	9513.44	4.04	1
we're going way back you're digging deep	9515.44	4.201	1
you're digging deep but yeah the	9517.48	5.0	1
Sentinels have made it work	9519.64	5.32	1
twice um clobbering through the site to	9522.48	4.281	1
get that plant down the first round	9524.96	3.56	1
pretty much secures the decision to want	9526.76	3.4	1
to buy on that second the little bit of	9528.52	4.64	1
extra money flowing them into a state	9530.16	4.48	1
where they want to rush with stingers	9533.16	3.279	1
and everybody behind each other makes it	9534.64	4.36	1
work again we see it a second time from	9536.44	5.121	1
Sentinels now loud has to wonder how	9539.0	5.0	1
they work they Low by you can expect Les	9541.56	4.52	1
to get some Sheriff shots in sure but	9544.0	4.24	1
how much damage can they do to stop sen	9546.08	4.92	1
from pulling back a bunch of rounds	9548.24	5.4	1
here this is a very similar situation as	9551.0	4.84	1
seen in previous Maps where the Stinger	9553.64	3.88	1
really allowed SEL to start building up	9555.84	3.28	1
a bit of that economy but La was still	9557.52	5.16	1
able to maintain no head	9559.12	6.44	1
shot just trying to go for wide swings	9562.68	5.24	1
after the kill the TP across now at the	9565.56	4.56	1
Helm of the push is T with the rest of	9567.92	4.479	1
SEL inside the B site should be an easy	9570.12	4.92	1
plan in the	9572.4	2.641	1
end right now it's cuses trying to keep	9575.24	4.96	1
them busy the other three are still	9577.8	4.08	1
trying to FL back deciding if they want	9580.2	4.56	0
a TP across or just try to fight at	9581.88	4.72	0
least one one player that could be	9584.76	4.2	1
straggling behind and that's John cutie	9586.6	6.12	1
waiting with that stinger in towards	9588.96	6.8	0
Sans safety for now is what loud chooses	9592.72	4.16	0
they don't want to have to clear too	9595.76	4.84	1
many angles on that and sadak has the	9596.88	5.599	1
knife how long are they going to wait	9600.6	3.12	1
for that well they're going to have to	9602.48	3.321	1
wait till next	9603.72	4.88	1
round yeah pretty much you could see it	9605.8	4.28	1
just trying to delay and trying to get	9608.6	3.28	1
at least one weapon and I love that it's	9610.08	3.399	1
also John cuy watching that plank with	9611.88	3.36	0
the Stinger so if they lose that one	9613.48	3.601	0
definitely here from loud's Camp they	9615.24	3.4	0
probably won't keep that Stinger unless	9617.08	3.16	0
you're you could probably get something	9618.64	4.12	0
done with that but at the same time	9620.24	5.159	0
though we're not only snowballing the	9622.76	6.32	0
economy from SEL after that for spy they	9625.4	5.841	0
also starting a snowball getting very	9629.08	5.92	0
close to these alts on the	9631.24	3.76	0
attack those alts could be met with a	9635.6	5.759	1
qck retaliate we will see getting it	9638.12	5.199	1
there hey sometimes it just takes a few	9641.36	4.441	1
bullets to calibrate okay hey that	9643.32	3.96	1
distance to instant pull down and get a	9645.8	2.92	1
shot like that that's	9647.28	4.281	1
sick great way to utilize that Stinger	9648.72	4.12	1
at that point you feel like your mouse	9651.56	3.839	1
is going to fall off your mouse pad 10	9652.84	5.4	1
to five here Sentinels starting a little	9655.4	5.641	1
bit of momentum we'll see if got to go	9658.24	5.92	1
fast is what they are thinking tens is	9661.04	4.68	1
going to make quick ground with a few	9664.16	4.159	1
steps before slamming on to	9665.72	5.04	1
shift they looks like it's going to be a	9668.32	3.641	1
quick pop	9670.76	3.679	1
flash seems to love doing not only a	9671.96	4.359	1
double flash but this time triple flash	9674.44	2.92	1
with a	9676.32	3.401	1
decoy push L away allowing the	9677.36	4.481	1
dimensional drift to come	9679.72	4.12	1
out pushing loud all the way back	9681.84	4.2	1
towards the spawn forcing The Defenders	9683.84	4.559	0
to play the	9686.04	6.52	0
retake quick take five towards the top	9688.4	5.481	0
side here for	9692.56	3.6	1
loud let's see where they decide to get	9693.88	3.92	1
in after these smokes clear because	9696.16	3.76	1
right now the delay is heavy from	9697.8	4.32	1
Sentinels qck will break the barrier	9699.92	4.6	1
first has to be him waiting for him to	9702.12	4.0	1
rotate back from the B side hit by the	9704.52	4.799	1
dog close range shorty denied right away	9706.12	4.72	1
but they get information of two players	9709.32	4.321	1
from C on the post m in U-Haul so for	9710.84	3.88	1
allow they're trying to fight back	9713.64	3.2	1
towards showers Sashi getting ready for	9714.72	3.8	1
a pop flash so they could swing back off	9716.84	3.439	1
the tap of the spike but there's	9718.52	4.32	1
theability off utility can't stick onto	9720.28	4.361	1
the diffuse quite yet cus gate is signed	9722.84	3.36	1
to move forward three players all the	9724.64	3.52	1
way back towards short a and the wall	9726.2	4.36	1
bang gets him but you saw that Molly	9728.16	3.76	1
that just came down there's not enough	9730.56	3.08	1
time here at this point and even not	9731.92	4.519	1
enough bodies to escape for loud	9733.64	5.4	1
everybody dies and sels they get round	9736.44	4.88	1
number six the post plant game is	9739.04	4.92	1
becoming so relevant here for the way	9741.32	5.761	1
Sentinels are playing we see John QD	9743.96	4.72	1
using Viper line on some different Maps	9747.08	3.64	1
as well here it's up to zelus to stay	9748.68	3.32	1
alive on these	9750.72	3.88	1
ones and a great push through the shower	9752.0	5.16	1
push we saw was actually Sentinels using	9754.6	5.24	1
loud smoke against them if a yoru	9757.16	5.319	1
bounces his flash off the floor inside a	9759.84	5.04	0
smoke it will pop flash right outside	9762.48	4.161	1
the bloom of the smoke almost impossible	9764.88	4.04	0
to dodge combine that with a saucy flash	9766.64	5.48	1
as well decoy and a decoy and Sentinels	9768.92	5.559	1
has answers for the defensive they're	9772.12	4.96	1
seeing answer right there as well	9774.48	4.201	1
exactly sometimes you only need utility	9777.08	3.359	0
just he tends to move forward and get	9778.68	2.639	1
that	9780.44	3.721	1
kill and he's going to control showers	9781.32	6.12	1
as the rest of SEL holding it back again	9784.16	4.92	1
understanding a lower by for loud in	9787.44	4.04	1
round number 17 fake teleport you see	9789.08	6.319	1
the very low buy that you currently have	9791.48	6.441	0
for the defensive side Crossfire set up	9795.4	5.521	0
with shotguns inside	9797.92	3.0	1
hookah it comes down now at the mid	9801.12	4.52	1
round for utility to be important for	9803.2	3.68	0
Sentinels to try to flush things out	9805.64	2.56	1
they have what it takes I mean the do	9806.88	5.04	1
the boom everything it be tough minute	9808.2	7.64	1
here T patience again pays off he'll	9811.92	5.72	1
have free alt orb here in a second if he	9815.84	4.04	1
wants it but more playing for the shot	9817.64	4.36	1
ready as they're waiting for this low by	9819.88	3.88	1
from loud to get antsy they start	9822.0	3.439	0
getting a few jiggle peaks in and that's	9823.76	3.2	0
just enough for S to connect with the	9825.44	2.96	1
crosshairs and that's the moment of	9826.96	4.12	1
hesitation coming from there's a minute	9828.4	4.241	1
left on the clock loud has no	9831.08	3.64	1
information of where sel's at so they	9832.64	3.56	1
have to start moving forward to get	9834.72	2.8	1
information because they also are	9836.2	3.079	1
playing a composition that doesn't	9837.52	3.56	1
really allow for them to scan anything	9839.28	3.721	1
out set for sadd's life it's a great	9841.08	4.199	1
point you don't scan you have to jump	9843.0	5.439	0
Peak things you sadd's not on the sky	9845.28	4.841	0
he's trying to hit a knife the knife can	9848.44	4.92	0
be dodged they cannot confirm much	9850.12	5.159	0
without putting themselves in danger in	9853.36	5.12	0
Sentinels is punishing that positioning	9855.28	5.16	0
every single one of those kills were	9858.48	3.92	1
just Sentinels posted at the right spot	9860.44	3.361	1
right everybody just walked into their	9862.4	3.641	1
cross there Peak they literally didn't	9863.8	4.44	0
even need to raise a finger move the	9866.04	3.439	1
mouse it just kept it there a whole	9868.24	3.28	1
round until finally tenens is trying to	9869.48	3.521	1
create some space and trying to find	9871.52	3.879	1
information and not only donates his	9873.0	5.0	1
life but allows for once again SEL to	9875.4	6.361	1
pick up here an ult that should be very	9878.0	5.359	0
important yeah with the dimensional	9881.76	3.4	0
drift for them to clear out the space	9883.36	3.241	1
and play the pulse plant that's been	9885.16	4.0	1
very good at so far I think we got a	9886.6	4.32	1
decent buy still for loud maybe a	9889.16	3.76	1
timeout call from them figuring out how	9890.92	4.08	1
they can start to defend what is	9892.92	3.92	1
happening from that side to say yep	9895.0	4.88	1
there it is they call through they need	9896.84	5.2	1
to stop the bleeding right now Sentinels	9899.88	4.76	1
has come up with four rounds in a lot of	9902.04	5.04	1
the rounds loud is not able to have	9904.64	5.04	0
their full member retake because they've	9907.08	4.88	0
been picked apart across the map of this	9909.68	5.04	0
default Sentinels continues to run and	9911.96	6.399	1
come up with so much so they they have a	9914.72	5.8	1
lot to throw at Sentinels here this	9918.36	4.481	1
could be around they get that cine	9920.52	4.64	1
ultimate up we've seen multi-kill rounds	9922.84	5.519	1
from him one after the other it's very	9925.16	4.64	0
possible they have three alts to fight	9928.36	3.801	0
back on this but Sentinels has a few on	9929.8	4.76	1
Deck as well this could be very chaotic	9932.16	4.159	1
they go back to that default Strat	9934.56	3.4	1
setting up at just about every point of	9936.32	3.521	1
the attack side to make sure loud isn't	9937.96	4.08	1
getting space and Sentinels we talked	9939.84	5.36	1
about it of loud's comp oh Sentinels	9942.04	5.84	0
knows that loud has to use their bodies	9945.2	4.96	0
to Peak they're their own sentries here	9947.88	5.479	0
if loud or if sadok's knife misses so	9950.16	5.08	0
they're always looking for these	9953.36	4.721	0
shots they're about to go for a four	9955.24	6.199	0
player hit towards the long B sign so	9958.08	4.84	0
with the initial noise that they made	9961.44	4.401	0
towards shers was an instant TP from T A	9962.92	5.76	0
jiggle now spotting a couple but it's	9965.84	5.12	0
instantly traed too many parties to deal	9968.68	5.0	0
against Les gets taken down and that's	9970.96	5.359	1
wall did	9973.68	5.36	1
Smoke's too far away to try to smoke it	9976.32	4.04	1
back out so it gives a chance now for	9979.04	3.359	1
Sentinels to move inside that sight	9980.36	3.521	1
that's why 10 gave his life away so he	9982.4	2.96	1
can have a dimensional to drift this	9983.88	2.88	1
round	9985.36	3.841	1
over allows sasi to get the plant and	9986.76	5.44	0
Seekers on top of it not yet cuz it gets	9989.2	4.96	1
denied from the after shot from elbow	9992.2	3.239	1
orbital strike but he's going to stick	9994.16	2.72	1
it	9995.44	4.84	1
still no Seekers there's a flank coming	9996.88	5.12	1
that could be huge right there cus	10000.28	3.601	1
getting the pick the execution onto	10002.0	4.6	1
zelus no coming out up to 10 of Don cue	10003.88	6.36	1
now up to 10 only and they cannot hold	10006.6	6.719	1
it took a while but seems as a loud	10010.24	5.119	1
finally were able to answer back on	10013.32	5.721	1
Sentinels po plant protocols team I like	10015.36	6.201	1
it from loud they split up the flashes	10019.04	4.6	1
they split up the aggressive entry and	10021.56	5.08	1
how it can hit the site and q's Thanos	10023.64	4.96	1
timing at long didn't even require any	10026.64	4.48	1
flashes he Peaks he kills and the rest	10028.6	4.52	1
of the team of loud is able to come	10031.12	4.12	0
through they did get that orbital strike	10033.12	4.68	0
out and Cen Zen does pick up the Rolling	10035.24	5.079	1
Thunder was we expected on that round so	10037.8	4.559	1
they can now fold over this power into	10040.32	4.281	1
another Victory to bring it to game	10042.36	4.801	1
Point again Sentinel still has quite a	10044.6	4.52	1
bit in the pocket for this round with	10047.16	5.84	1
ultimates in Z and zelus and	10049.12	3.88	1
Sai crash down a walk down down with	10054.32	7.721	1
Brimstone as well not even that	10058.64	7.24	1
speed it just went with a Brim St	10062.04	6.439	1
flash taking control of B instant	10065.88	4.76	1
rotating but with that look at SEL they	10068.48	4.88	1
haven't budged at all loud's been very	10070.64	5.24	1
Pro proactive rather with this type of	10073.36	6.04	1
composition on their defensive	10075.88	3.519	1
signs imagine imagine they find	10080.28	5.04	1
something there right L's protocol is to	10082.92	5.479	1
just fight a war at Fountain it be long	10085.32	4.721	1
Sentinels are now going to try to rehit	10088.4	3.96	1
this area to see just how much came down	10090.04	5.319	1
and qk out of it first Blood pretends	10092.36	5.881	1
there allow Seekers to come out too to	10095.36	4.241	1
force to rotate even that Rolling	10098.24	3.199	1
Thunder you mentioned before from cine	10099.6	4.24	1
it's pinned towards that b site and now	10101.44	5.04	1
it's R by loud that small Split Second	10103.84	6.16	1
saw the TP heard the TP so SEL now have	10106.48	6.481	1
to at least try to gain some ground loud	10110.0	4.6	1
trying to be ready for this one but SEL	10112.96	3.24	1
also post it up so they can TP away if	10114.6	3.879	0
they need to should Z not get the picks	10116.2	4.8	0
with a sh stopper and you don't expect	10118.48	5.401	0
the timing Les does look inside the	10121.0	4.6	0
smoke though Sak gets the tra back off	10123.88	3.92	0
the S second pushing all the way forward	10125.6	3.679	0
a double towards the back of the sight	10127.8	4.599	0
he does get the first pick up	10129.28	3.12	0
the the TB came across like they wanted	10132.68	6.36	0
to for Sentinels loud eating into the	10135.84	5.559	1
strategy eating into the bait and we'll	10139.04	4.76	1
have S pstat now towards the be site and	10141.4	5.281	1
there's a bit of the Singler Pro play	10143.8	5.32	1
from each one of them strength coming	10146.68	6.2	1
out and some Allstars there now up to	10149.12	6.96	1
cenen great shot captain I it's going to	10152.88	4.64	1
be a tough one to get this down with	10156.08	3.359	1
what what's going to be happening	10157.52	3.28	1
obviously he just looks for the exit	10159.44	2.721	1
kills that's going to happen to him but	10160.8	3.76	1
with 10's coming around on the outside	10162.16	5.239	1
of this round his teleport from B gate	10164.56	5.96	1
crashed into spawn so Les had an inkling	10167.4	4.681	0
yeah there's going to be a Teleport but	10170.52	3.48	1
maybe it's a little bit later and tens	10172.08	3.399	0
finally found that timing even though	10174.0	4.479	0
Les did look it just shows you just how	10175.48	5.481	1
patient sends pushing forward how much	10178.48	4.161	1
they're making loud have to consider	10180.96	3.92	1
this angle or this when loud just wants	10182.64	4.679	1
to be watching the sight take and and	10184.88	5.12	1
denying another kill for cenen as we're	10187.32	4.601	1
get to teleport out of zelis searching a	10190.0	3.2	0
little blood in the water but they	10191.92	4.64	1
cannot take him down cin still been	10193.2	4.96	1
doing a very good job getting a lot of	10196.56	4.2	1
value out of these fault lines to not	10198.16	4.44	1
only set up himself but his teammates	10200.76	3.12	1
but the amount of times we saw I think	10202.6	3.679	1
it was twice in this series so far we	10203.88	4.84	1
was able to get a fa line Aftershock	10206.28	5.801	1
combination to get picks get kills so	10208.72	7.84	1
utility is still quite good here for Lou	10212.08	6.239	1
but again it it comes down to that story	10216.56	3.28	1
line on that second half on that four	10218.32	3.201	1
spy Stinger that we had from Sentinels	10219.84	3.2	1
allowing for them to pick up four rounds	10221.52	3.48	1
in a row now finally going back and	10223.04	5.359	1
forth loud still in the lead by three	10225.0	5.439	1
10's looking for showers control solo	10228.4	3.121	1
with the	10230.44	3.641	1
shorty flash being initiated down	10231.52	5.08	1
towards long B though for Sentinels to	10234.08	4.08	1
try to see if somebody's going to try to	10236.6	4.879	1
tap an orb trying to deny it away from	10238.16	6.279	1
qck but he's got two he with him shoots	10241.48	5.361	1
first first tp's away and he's gone now	10244.44	3.721	1
they have to worry I mean they heard the	10246.84	3.8	1
TP was it fake you're going to leave one	10248.16	4.44	1
they can at least clear out and start to	10250.64	4.52	1
lean the other way calls from loud are	10252.6	4.24	1
going to say be Long's getting hit right	10255.16	4.119	1
now so just be sturdy in your positions	10256.84	4.559	1
cine starts them off great way to be	10259.28	4.801	1
stury the head shot through a couple of	10261.4	4.241	1
walls dropping	10264.08	4.12	1
one right now Sentinels are trying to	10265.64	5.08	1
move in towards this B site baiting out	10268.2	5.32	1
util baiting out the Aftershock first	10270.72	4.559	1
potentially even the rolling Thunder as	10273.52	3.839	1
louder all towards the back of that site	10275.28	5.641	1
trying to wall bang off the tap John cue	10277.36	5.281	1
getting the plant and also getting the	10280.92	4.2	1
pit activates it on the top of the B	10282.64	5.0	1
site but remember qk meanwhile picked up	10285.12	4.56	1
the orb on showers so they have Rolling	10287.64	4.56	1
Thunder and run it back to try to go	10289.68	4.719	1
directly against this here it comes	10292.2	4.48	1
right now as qk leads the charge looking	10294.4	3.601	1
through trying to spat some players	10296.68	3.4	1
there's the headshot onto John cutie pit	10298.0	4.479	1
will now come down more information as T	10300.08	5.159	1
inside the Smoke traed Out by there's	10302.48	5.121	0
only one player left at celsus fully	10305.24	5.481	0
flash does get the back the two a two	10307.6	5.08	1
versus one only as it's going to work	10310.72	5.08	1
with almost got the clutch but Tu was	10312.68	5.599	1
there for the trade the	10315.8	7.88	1
diffuse and L will be at that point game	10318.28	8.521	1
five Lotus on the horizon loud's time	10323.68	6.24	1
out paying dividends a few rounds ago to	10326.8	5.12	1
find a way to get the brimstone ultimate	10329.92	4.16	0
in then a few rounds later the Rolling	10331.92	5.559	1
Thunder in and now the retake on the	10334.08	6.92	1
site again loud find success they stay	10337.48	5.401	1
alive one enemy remaining and they have	10341.0	4.52	1
a chance to push us once more to our	10342.88	4.88	1
final map still a lot of chances four	10345.52	5.919	1
even for send to get to the OT here loud	10347.76	5.679	1
almost has this one locked down but you	10351.44	3.8	1
cannot give it to anyone just yet with	10353.44	3.561	1
the way they've been playing See How	10355.24	3.481	1
They jump into this next round where	10357.0	3.2	1
they're going what they're doing 10's	10358.72	3.719	1
ready off the rip for dimensional drift	10360.2	3.8	1
and he's going to start just throwing	10362.44	3.721	1
out in to the team here we'll see how	10364.0	4.16	1
loud reacts you got money to work with	10366.16	4.119	1
here for s in round number 21 Back	10368.16	3.76	1
Against The Wall spotting sadak inside	10370.28	5.481	1
U-Haul M to P to push them back they try	10371.92	5.559	1
to regain control Les has a judge but	10375.76	4.2	1
he's towards the bide qck and two	10377.48	6.441	1
holding the a site down off Dien drift	10379.96	6.12	1
information trying to get utility behind	10383.92	4.84	1
and sprays behind it it's actually loud	10386.08	4.92	1
that capitalizes on all of these kills	10388.76	5.679	1
tens alone against the world how bad you	10391.0	5.84	1
guys want a	10394.44	2.401	1
computer TS a lot of work ahead of him	10397.52	6.68	1
here and I'm sure Kaplan is looking at	10401.16	6.48	1
the Lotus Notes at this point what a	10404.2	7.0	1
great two maps from loud incredibly hard	10407.64	6.32	1
fought on the last map of ice box that	10411.2	5.32	1
was such a back and forth he does get	10413.96	4.76	1
the first Contact still 40 seconds to	10416.52	4.28	1
work with doesn't have any more gate	10418.72	4.0	0
crashes so he can't really come through	10420.8	3.76	0
walking through the snake bite as well	10422.72	3.96	0
yeah and that's going to make it even	10424.56	5.44	1
more difficult coming out from Les judge	10426.68	5.36	0
inside T dancing around the corner of	10430.0	4.68	0
that pit walks in right now to pick it	10432.04	5.279	0
up no way as he walks across the TP	10434.68	5.44	0
though waiting is it going to get	10437.32	5.361	1
cleared across they didn't see him he	10440.12	5.44	1
made it through this 14 seconds left T	10442.68	6.2	1
chases him down we will be going into a	10445.56	6.36	1
final map to decide the winner of he's	10448.88	5.0	1
not scared of taking the entire Team B	10451.92	5.08	1
for around loud's going to have to be	10453.88	6.04	1
ready for that looks like that Spike may	10457.0	5.64	0
actually Trend towards that	10459.92	5.479	0
area and they do get a bit of Mount not	10462.64	5.2	1
Mount control but Rubble control on that	10465.4	5.08	1
left side with a Guiding Light to start	10467.84	5.04	1
no big commitment just yet for loud they	10470.48	5.321	1
do Peak them oh but TW is still there	10472.88	5.04	1
the third player door opening as well so	10475.8	3.559	0
they're trying to pinch in trying to	10477.92	3.6	1
Pivot between C or B depending where the	10479.36	4.201	1
picks are going to be from Sentinels	10481.52	4.52	1
it's on the C side to decide as three	10483.56	5.0	1
players fall for loud plant coming in	10486.04	4.199	1
kadine trying to get a for position	10488.56	3.679	1
trying to catch one off guard and Sak on	10490.24	4.641	0
the flank instantly we have a 2v2 c PIV	10492.24	4.321	1
towards the back gets the head shot as	10494.88	4.519	1
well allowing sedak to win against s the	10496.56	5.52	1
old teammates going head to-head Susy	10499.4	5.0	1
reposition around the Trailblazer	10502.08	3.92	1
swinging out the long range of the	10504.4	5.201	1
frenzy does not connect and s's ghost	10506.0	6.12	0
neither Oria with the ghost here moving	10509.6	5.36	0
forward now the re swing out from SED H	10512.12	4.6	1
being thrown knowing that he towards the	10514.96	5.04	1
back up towards the air the shot from	10516.72	6.84	1
above SOS get the pistol incredible	10520.0	6.479	1
Movement by Sashi sadok always buys a	10523.56	5.08	1
frenzy in a one V one situation there	10526.48	3.601	0
he's closing the	10528.64	4.839	0
distance sashy creates more sadak closes	10530.08	6.159	1
the distance Sashi creates more stays	10533.48	4.161	1
out of the range of the frenzy gets the	10536.24	4.24	1
ghost kill Sentinels have round one and	10537.64	5.16	1
that is a modified gun round strp for	10540.48	5.201	1
Sentinels that will usually see Z by	10542.8	6.2	1
himself at door opening it once be long	10545.68	6.12	1
has made contact they went two and two	10549.0	4.92	1
to make sure zin's Excursion into the	10551.8	5.559	1
doorway was not tainted by any B defense	10553.92	6.12	1
from loud crazy stuff by Sentinels there	10557.36	4.88	1
to modify that make it work for a pistol	10560.04	5.68	1
round loud now losing one already yeah	10562.24	5.561	1
losing one that b main Peak again	10565.72	5.36	1
Sentinels F A score there and 10's	10567.8	5.24	1
getting pretty hurt from that situation	10571.08	4.76	1
o good tra back to just just chip damage	10573.04	4.239	1
being traded but this is benefiting	10575.84	4.36	1
Sentinels obviously goes long range so	10577.28	6.641	1
zelis is still semi healthy 63 HP as	10580.2	6.079	1
Sentinels after the initial kill reset	10583.92	4.68	1
back towards C we'll get the same	10586.28	4.441	1
scenario this time with no more bodies	10588.6	4.04	1
up for	10590.72	4.4	1
loud Z trying to get the long range	10592.64	4.04	1
couldn't work it with the singer uses a	10595.12	4.4	0
classic instead back and forth we go	10596.68	5.28	1
though with a fault line timing Bucky	10599.52	4.839	1
close range John cutie standing not that	10601.96	5.399	1
t had his back but at least has the	10604.36	5.96	1
trade qck the only thing that he has now	10607.36	5.281	1
is a	10610.32	2.321	1
classic trying to find the opportunity	10613.0	4.2	0
moment to walk inside the smoke the	10615.0	4.92	1
backup from tens the turn around and	10617.2	4.199	1
then both of them swinging from	10619.92	4.08	1
extremities Well Done by Sentinels an	10621.4	4.88	0
opportunity there for loud to get the	10624.0	5.239	0
upset but Sentinels convert from their	10626.28	6.281	1
pistol loud again playing this	10629.24	6.0	1
composition that a little bit with their	10632.56	4.56	0
bodies obviously two is pushing there to	10635.24	3.361	0
get map control and see if they could	10637.12	2.96	0
have started to lean but now they do	10638.6	3.679	1
have sadak with guiding lights they	10640.08	4.279	1
don't have to go as crazy so we'll see	10642.28	4.96	1
what this gun round brings	10644.36	5.721	1
us like wait a minute that was a little	10647.24	5.08	0
too close for my comfort says Kaplan	10650.08	3.68	0
it's been a long night and a long day	10652.32	2.881	1
for the	10653.76	5.08	1
coach all right our first one towards	10655.2	5.96	1
rubble a wide swing to the orb didn't	10658.84	4.0	1
even come up Zin gets the surprise kill	10661.16	3.56	1
onto kaaden	10662.84	4.399	1
knowing that the other one was behind	10664.72	5.88	1
the boxes but tped away that's two e	10667.24	5.601	1
forced to Anchor solo a double push from	10670.6	4.6	1
loud to try to flank around towards C	10672.84	3.92	1
that will be bit by utility in a couple	10675.2	3.88	1
of seconds as zelis moves forward with	10676.76	3.719	0
the rest of the	10679.08	4.92	0
team this flank is huge exactly and	10680.48	4.92	0
actually as zelis is moving forward	10684.0	4.08	0
there's no alarm bot it's not really	10685.4	4.601	0
activated here's that timing moving	10688.08	3.68	0
forward now as there you go moved back	10690.0	4.2	1
towards the doorway alarm bot came up	10691.76	5.08	0
and that spots at least one player SEL	10694.2	5.96	1
are now ready for the backstab John CU	10696.84	4.76	1
is the one that greets him on the corner	10700.16	4.72	1
of the Boxes by baby door one-onone that	10701.6	5.16	0
situation door opening forward SEL are	10704.88	3.8	0
looking pretty good here in round number	10706.76	5.24	1
three their bonus Les dancing around the	10708.68	5.44	0
peak up from zelus at Rubble the push	10712.0	5.479	0
towards the spawn from z a sentinal	10714.12	6.56	1
score the Flawless what are they doing	10717.48	5.241	1
they keep opening the door they still	10720.68	4.12	1
got the flank and they're just playing	10722.72	4.16	1
games out here right now as loud tries	10724.8	5.08	0
to get back into the site and Loud was	10726.88	5.2	0
having trouble sedak threw one of his	10729.88	4.24	0
his flashes it link stairs and it just	10732.08	3.8	1
found itself going into the wall because	10734.12	3.239	1
it was tried to be thrown through a	10735.88	4.2	0
smoke little things not working for loud	10737.36	3.92	1
that they would have gained a bit of	10740.08	4.8	1
ground and Sentinels just biting back	10741.28	7.681	1
let's go zelis absolutely feeling it out	10744.88	5.72	1
of his chair right now with the hype	10748.96	3.96	1
from the crowd and we're in ground gun	10750.6	3.96	1
round or round four I should say guns	10752.92	5.64	0
for S not for loud and Sentinels worried	10754.56	5.6	0
that this could be a round of trickery	10758.56	3.36	1
leave the spike in spawn for now as they	10760.16	4.48	1
do a bit of Recon the first push though	10761.92	4.88	1
from TU here on loud yeah and did so	10764.64	3.88	1
with the Recon prowling towards the B	10766.8	5.28	1
main as well did catch a player and as	10768.52	5.44	1
they go for the swing on Mound they once	10772.08	3.64	1
again see the Viper set up towards that	10773.96	3.0	1
Seas	10775.72	3.12	1
site and definitely here as you're	10776.96	5.12	0
seeing SEL working that map quite	10778.84	5.72	0
well zels is standing up at the end of	10782.08	5.88	0
these rounds also is the hype men that	10784.56	5.6	0
you need for SOS to try to close this	10787.96	4.96	0
map number five wow yeah really we're	10790.16	4.52	1
showing the respect to loud showstopper	10792.92	3.8	1
coming out creating that space on the	10794.68	3.96	1
Low by that you have and cine somehow	10796.72	4.84	0
manages to slip through the execution of	10798.64	5.56	0
Sentinels to get one pick with his Bucky	10801.56	4.44	0
nonetheless little plant will still come	10804.2	4.8	0
down honestly show stopper in you know	10806.0	4.6	1
sadok's not going to be too close with	10809.0	3.72	1
the judge if he has one that round yeah	10810.6	3.719	1
you're right playing it safe playing it	10812.72	2.84	1
strong and they're looking to deny the	10814.32	3.881	1
audio on the retake too yeah that's	10815.56	4.839	0
going to hit So Many Bodies even all	10818.2	5.6	1
four of them towards this B site all La	10820.4	5.04	1
could do right now is just hold the back	10823.8	3.08	1
waiting for that to dissipate the Wall	10825.44	3.281	1
comes up thankfully because Les is still	10826.88	3.559	1
alive big curve ball the double swing	10828.72	4.44	1
out of it Sashi is going to fall trying	10830.44	4.721	1
to play the pul plan here tuis jumps up	10833.16	4.119	1
on the ledge starts to fuse instantly we	10835.16	4.199	1
get the sprays on two kills Q then	10837.28	3.561	1
swinging out there's not going to be	10839.36	3.721	1
enough time left John CU is just staying	10840.84	4.2	1
alive and trying to force out Les	10843.08	5.04	1
towards him Les falls back Spike will	10845.04	5.96	1
explode the round for	10848.12	6.119	1
Sentinels four for S they do go down to	10851.0	5.84	1
one member but the coffers are full	10854.24	4.24	1
they've got so much money from the first	10856.84	5.04	1
four rounds here the ultimates to come	10858.48	5.76	1
up but we'll see this round again	10861.88	5.16	1
pressuring into the sight you can see	10864.24	5.561	1
that Sentinels is not kidding around	10867.04	5.6	1
show stoer on a low by round for	10869.8	5.88	1
loud they are securing these imagine if	10872.64	4.52	1
they didn't show stopper it came down to	10875.68	3.96	1
a One V one the site might have had a	10877.16	4.079	1
different play all the way through that	10879.64	4.12	1
round fist bus all around zis as well	10881.24	4.921	1
still in his first two maps remember we	10883.76	4.8	1
definitely saw a one-sided Affair for	10886.16	5.119	1
Sentinels as well so L seems like they	10888.56	4.799	1
might be digging deep right now to	10891.28	4.521	1
answer back on their defensive half this	10893.36	4.481	1
becomes interesting right it's not the	10895.8	3.92	1
the Rays and the fade nade here coming	10897.84	4.12	1
from loud so this is more of a firefight	10899.72	5.44	1
util hit but send can run out and answer	10901.96	4.439	1
right they're not too deterred from	10905.16	2.84	1
making this happen unless they get	10906.4	3.161	1
nailed by that fault	10908.0	4.359	1
line it's already coming out TP went	10909.56	5.24	1
forward though look at 10 double TP on	10912.36	6.161	1
both ends but's winning that one low HP	10914.8	6.72	1
door being opened sedak forced to fall	10918.52	5.28	0
back flash to try to get information the	10921.52	4.52	1
prowler fall right behind his second for	10923.8	5.559	1
three in the round a sight open for	10926.04	7.08	1
business and sels shuts down the defense	10929.36	6.481	1
I won't it's impossible but you just saw	10933.12	4.92	1
how hard it is for loud to actually	10935.84	4.519	1
control that space with the majority of	10938.04	4.199	1
the util they wanted to take it two	10940.36	3.561	1
members of Sentinels able to shut that	10942.24	5.841	1
down as tens and Zen go forward now they	10943.92	6.28	1
play the plant game all in tree they	10948.08	3.359	1
should be able to trade each other here	10950.2	2.88	1
but a good fault line could pick up a	10951.44	3.641	1
few does enough damage though for the	10953.08	4.52	1
assist last one now spotted snake by not	10955.08	4.239	1
allowing Les to move even more forward	10957.6	3.839	1
behind that two versus one second SN by	10959.32	5.441	1
Nanos two toxic and second dinosaur	10961.44	5.721	1
coming down wasting all of that time	10964.76	4.04	1
counter moving forward to tap on the	10967.16	3.64	1
spike one has to run across easy kill	10968.8	3.639	1
Crosshair placement but zelus knows	10970.8	4.16	1
better then swings that off the timing	10972.44	8.0	1
five now four Sentinels Crow behind him	10974.96	7.8	1
ascal continue to build the confidence	10980.44	4.401	1
in the final map and these rounds are a	10982.76	3.92	1
bloodbath loud's not getting the chance	10984.84	3.479	1
to save neither as send but they're	10986.68	3.36	1
coming up with the frags they're coming	10988.32	4.04	1
up with the round wins and John Cy is	10990.04	5.12	1
currently sitting on nine ,000 credits	10992.36	4.161	1
they can be buying each other if they	10995.16	3.119	1
want to they're staying away from an	10996.52	4.759	1
operator Sentinels is keeping a	10998.28	6.721	1
fastpac game to not let loud breathe	11001.28	7.08	1
right now loud into a big Sheriff	11005.0	5.64	1
guardian and vandel	11008.36	4.641	1
round they're stretching the money fin	11010.64	4.48	1
here and they go again for Rubble play	11013.0	3.52	1
keep doing it why not but this time	11015.12	3.0	1
we're answering back for loud lots of	11016.52	2.959	1
utility to try to clear back towards	11018.12	2.96	1
Rubble two is moving forward that's the	11019.48	4.041	1
sher's going to work now for loud and	11021.08	5.359	1
ring back is Assi but they pull back	11023.52	4.879	1
from it dropping a spike in the process	11026.44	3.84	1
it comes down to the men right here the	11028.4	4.561	1
hype man that made it Behind Enemy Lines	11030.28	4.881	0
and is trying to catch to	11032.96	5.479	0
rotate they refin the hit said it	11035.16	4.84	0
wouldn't be	11038.44	5.04	0
impossible too late the pick from zelus	11040.0	5.84	0
opening it up up towards the a site so	11043.48	4.88	0
they can pitch towards the rubble but	11045.84	3.96	0
the backs side's about to come forward	11048.36	3.96	0
from Les but he lost Kena the process	11049.8	5.28	0
the jump for it backstab they on to	11052.32	5.721	1
zelus spike El is picked up by John Cy	11055.08	5.68	1
with the pit available Viper on viper	11058.04	5.6	1
both pits also available comes down to	11060.76	4.32	1
who has the better read the better	11063.64	5.16	1
positioning it's John	11065.08	3.72	1
cuy absurd momentum right now electric	11070.92	8.64	1
from Sentinels the players are feeling	11076.6	5.36	1
it and they are delivering it to each	11079.56	4.4	1
other in these moments as well	11081.96	5.56	1
what a round loud again refined the a	11083.96	6.24	1
rubble hit they get it right but the	11087.52	5.759	1
round still goes in the favor of s as	11090.2	5.84	1
they're able to organize a hell of a	11093.28	5.2	1
flank to come in and completely pick	11096.04	4.239	1
apart loud four ultimates now ready for	11098.48	3.88	1
loud here three for Sentinels an	11100.28	4.721	0
explosive Round Here on round seven as	11102.36	5.161	0
the Odin unleashes from zela's hands	11105.0	4.2	1
they want to keep doing it for loud they	11107.52	4.32	0
had some sort of result there for the	11109.2	4.36	0
control they had towards Rob but the	11111.84	3.28	0
thing is they had a lower bu this time	11113.56	3.879	0
they wanted to do it with weapons SEL	11115.12	3.52	0
could have been lucky with the spray	11117.44	4.04	1
from zelus from the a entrance but that	11118.64	4.36	1
means you have no Defenders towards the	11121.48	3.92	1
seaside allowing for SEL to be exactly	11123.0	4.359	1
where they P it up at the beginning of	11125.4	4.241	1
this round Open up The Kill on to Le SCH	11127.36	5.161	1
stoer in does not get the contact Q is	11129.64	5.04	1
just around the corner run it back out	11132.52	4.36	1
and activated big curveball the head	11134.68	4.88	1
shot on to T Rolling Thunder also	11136.88	5.479	1
available here for cine and it's just to	11139.56	4.679	1
try to push them back back and allowing	11142.36	4.321	1
Kus to move forward for another pick	11144.24	3.721	1
lock down available at the beginning of	11146.68	3.12	1
this round for zelus as they had to	11147.96	4.84	0
reset regroup and	11149.8	3.0	0
rethink this would be a wild round they	11152.96	4.6	0
lose less first and are able to answer	11155.44	4.441	0
back now loud going to win this one from	11157.56	5.48	1
a 4v5 conversion possibly they correctly	11159.88	6.04	1
rotate and the just the ruse they're	11163.04	4.199	1
going to be sticking together though so	11165.92	3.08	1
it doesn't matter oh it does you're	11167.24	3.721	1
right it does they second guess it and	11169.0	3.08	1
now they're going to be rotating	11170.96	3.84	1
together power in number but the wrong	11172.08	5.72	1
sight and now it has to come down to a	11174.8	5.16	1
perfect timing from Sassi The Flash	11177.8	3.96	1
actually did not spot zelis he hears the	11179.96	4.16	1
footsteps once Sassi gets this plant	11181.76	4.88	1
it'll pull the rotate back but celsus is	11184.12	4.8	1
overthinking it over peing and gets Den	11186.64	6.12	1
n right away SP planted sashy had this	11188.92	6.16	1
chance before on Sunset that was the	11192.76	5.639	1
wingman plant we saw when he was on the	11195.08	5.6	1
gecko does he have the timing here to	11198.4	3.92	1
get behind his opponents hearing the	11200.68	3.96	1
audio hearing the the Stampede of loud	11202.32	5.08	1
go by him a Deja Vu here's the footsteps	11204.64	5.92	1
but this time the dreams been learn been	11207.4	7.201	1
read but Sassi wakes up Cene a two	11210.56	7.08	1
versus one paranoia hits him trying to	11214.6	4.839	1
get the spray across at least gets that	11217.64	4.36	1
second kill but L will get the diffuse	11219.44	4.8	1
loud find it they need this round	11222.0	3.84	1
Sentinel still has so much money but	11224.24	3.761	1
loud needed to stop the bleeding they	11225.84	4.08	1
were hemorrhaging rounds one after the	11228.0	4.0	1
other ultimates are ready for Sentinels	11229.92	3.92	1
so they may as well they might just take	11232.0	4.08	0
this back in their favor with what they	11233.84	4.88	0
have liking be with this setup we've	11236.08	4.84	0
seen them hit B with Nightfall with what	11238.72	4.16	0
they have and T can really mess around	11240.92	4.92	0
with a spawn TP if he gets it what a	11242.88	5.479	1
round from	11245.84	5.599	1
loud playing that one together rotating	11248.36	4.721	1
correct but they know they have a long	11251.44	3.081	1
road ahead of them to collect the rest	11253.08	3.399	1
of these rounds in the first half here's	11254.52	3.28	1
that b hit we were talking about from	11256.48	4.88	1
Sentinels not afraid to just send	11257.8	3.559	1
it rare hit toward towards that b site	11261.44	4.321	1
that paranoia is going to Blind too but	11264.12	3.56	1
close range still gets the kill with the	11265.76	4.16	1
guardian Q also moving forward After	11267.68	5.04	0
Shock forcing SEL to push forward but	11269.92	4.92	0
it's traed back and forth send back on	11272.72	4.96	0
the board two's answering right back pit	11274.84	5.24	1
is down counter coming out of Defenders	11277.68	5.12	1
less at low HP though K CU still at full	11280.08	4.92	1
with	11282.8	2.2	1
armor it's like sherber let's go oh a	11286.4	6.801	1
shot outside John cutie finds one as he	11290.64	5.679	1
one enemy remaining oneon-one though Les	11293.2	5.239	1
has that snake bite John cuy playing all	11296.32	4.801	1
the way on the outside Ling that pit	11298.44	5.721	1
down Les doing the same wall up tap on	11301.12	5.96	1
the spike John cue the sprays on the	11304.16	4.64	1
first it's halfway a little bit of a tap	11307.08	3.399	1
trying to stick it it's going to release	11308.8	4.32	1
it now gets the kill tries to go back	11310.48	5.321	1
for the diffuse will he get it he will	11313.12	6.44	1
not last in a second but John Cy wins	11315.8	5.519	1
the one one	11319.56	4.36	1
71 Sentinels	11321.32	5.441	1
up they pull it back in their favor we	11323.92	5.8	1
talked about the be hit how hard it is	11326.76	5.28	1
once you get that night fall in the	11329.72	4.2	1
close members on the defensive side	11332.04	4.76	1
playing B cannot orchestrate around any	11333.92	5.28	1
audio they're deafened they're trying to	11336.8	4.4	1
play off full reaction and that usually	11339.2	3.159	1
means you're getting met with the	11341.2	3.119	1
utility that follows up after the	11342.36	4.88	1
Nightfall and you are falling what	11344.32	6.521	1
around good pressure good play 710 here	11347.24	6.24	1
it's going to be a low by again for loud	11350.84	4.399	1
which means sen should be able to pick	11353.48	3.281	1
up this	11355.24	4.441	1
round as we say that though Cowen Zen's	11356.76	4.44	1
been getting a lot of value out of this	11359.68	3.04	1
Bucky so far slipping through towards	11361.2	3.119	1
the seaside hits and the sheriff has	11362.72	6.0	1
always been really good on qck less and	11364.32	8.281	1
tues walking towards qck our Sentinels	11368.72	5.44	0
after doing some initial noise towards	11372.6	3.0	1
the	11374.16	3.96	1
site do they grab Mound control now	11375.6	4.32	1
though yes perfect from loud they can	11378.12	3.4	1
start to move the rest of the map here	11379.92	3.479	1
they need to get a faster read on	11381.52	3.52	1
Sentinels the retake from loud is	11383.4	3.601	0
amazing with their flashes they got to	11385.04	3.88	1
be in position the dog came out too	11387.0	3.399	1
control towards Mound there is that	11388.92	4.12	0
instant rotate from Cowen Zen and sedak	11390.4	4.321	0
all the rest of the team they're still	11393.04	5.439	1
under a minute qy under initial	11394.72	6.44	1
pressure orb now being picked up Pain's	11398.48	4.361	1
moving forward juus gets the wall bang	11401.16	3.76	1
it's a bait for the bucket move forward	11402.84	3.84	1
but second was ready for that one cull	11404.92	4.439	1
under right tried to look for the safety	11406.68	4.92	0
John C is able to make it back but SED	11409.36	4.721	1
pinches from the back	11411.6	5.24	1
3v3 but once again the better buy is for	11414.08	4.48	1
the attacker sasi pushing forward	11416.84	5.399	1
against d a plant safe now towards the	11418.56	5.32	1
right side of the sight Sak got a	11422.24	4.841	1
Guardian guardian picked up Les moving	11423.88	4.8	1
forward watching their angles jumping	11427.08	3.48	1
out Guardian shot does not connect and	11428.68	4.84	1
instantly both players of Val fall with	11430.56	5.879	1
the crossfire set up from the Sentinels	11433.52	5.44	0
dominating now the attacking side	11436.44	4.641	1
dominating just like he did on the first	11438.96	5.24	1
two maps of Sentinels they're definitely	11441.08	4.319	1
really looking like they're running	11444.2	3.64	1
towards the victory of this final map	11445.4	4.08	1
this is	11447.84	4.559	1
incredible right now from Sentinels one	11449.48	6.321	1
enemy remaining we always pray sadak the	11452.4	7.04	1
five games the long uous process of	11455.8	5.76	1
having to restat every map figure out	11459.44	3.8	1
your opponents he's been there he's done	11461.56	4.719	1
that amazing to see how Sentinels is	11463.24	5.12	1
molding to the situation John cue	11466.28	4.681	0
continues to call well and we know zelus	11468.36	4.12	0
just on the back side of those calls	11470.96	3.96	1
adding so much information and SEL could	11472.48	4.321	1
do whatever they want right now can	11474.92	3.2	1
they're going back into that pressure	11476.8	2.8	1
towards the rubble sign we're like okay	11478.12	2.92	1
well when we have these big gun rounds	11479.6	3.0	1
they might try to pressure on that side	11481.04	3.6	0
SEL could work now the B moving back	11482.6	4.0	1
towards C and this is pistol repeat	11484.64	4.4	1
right this is exactly what Sentinel did	11486.6	4.92	1
on pistol round it's a a sure grab on	11489.04	4.319	1
orb now they pick up the spike and they	11491.52	4.36	1
can decide what they want to do haven't	11493.36	4.241	1
had to worry about this a rubble	11495.88	4.399	1
pressure at all really they just let it	11497.6	3.96	1
happen and make sure they watch the	11500.28	4.361	1
flank looking forward now s has only but	11501.56	5.96	1
what's in front of them for this B take	11504.64	4.599	1
having John cutie with the spike back	11507.52	3.04	1
there makes me think this isn't a full	11509.24	3.16	1
hit though a this is big right now for	11510.56	4.32	1
Lou you had Sadat we talked about agents	11512.4	4.121	1
that needs to get information he dogged	11514.88	4.24	1
out at the 115 then goes for Seekers at	11516.52	4.36	1
the one minute even to run it back to	11519.12	3.199	1
try to get the late round and even the	11520.88	4.68	1
pick onto zelus denied by John cuy still	11522.32	4.801	1
an opportunity here for Sentinels to	11525.56	2.839	0
Pivot away if they want to and it's	11527.12	3.84	1
starting here sash is moving forward but	11528.4	5.321	1
is waited by Tu for the rest is just	11530.96	6.24	1
second throwing the pain shells cat them	11533.72	5.24	1
moving up towards the B site for a plant	11537.2	4.84	1
SAU sashy solo clears haunt right on a	11538.96	5.359	1
rubble pushes back with the Seas and	11542.04	4.0	1
again there's still an audible to be	11544.32	3.641	1
called here from Sentinels they haven't	11546.04	3.96	1
finished to where they're going it might	11547.96	4.04	1
be B in the end though yeah 14 seconds	11550.0	3.12	1
left it's now coming in towards this	11552.0	2.64	1
bite but there's still players here four	11553.12	2.96	1
players looking to flood back from loud	11554.64	3.56	1
in the back of the forward position from	11556.08	4.64	1
Sassi on the top of the heavens winning	11558.2	3.68	1
just behind the smoke here's the	11560.72	3.24	1
footsteps root across on the back of the	11561.88	3.8	1
spawn now as it dissipates there the	11563.96	3.279	1
contact paranoia was a little bit too	11565.68	3.48	1
late H then moves forth though and two	11567.24	4.481	1
answer is right back it's back and forth	11569.16	5.8	1
a Congo line of kills but the advantage	11571.72	6.12	1
for allow door opening qck looking for	11574.96	4.72	1
the flank clearing out the front B both	11577.84	3.439	1
players of senal anchoring inside the	11579.68	3.36	1
side the curveball turned away by John	11581.28	4.04	1
cu the ads for the train second now	11583.04	4.16	1
Satchel available to try to get the	11585.32	3.92	1
diffuser off the plant but he's going to	11587.2	4.64	1
swing out first and knows now that they	11589.24	4.881	1
have to commit two are is ready for it	11591.84	4.2	1
though and fights back allowing loud to	11594.12	4.92	1
get to the fuse what a necessary round	11596.04	4.84	1
and they actually Focus two ultimate	11599.04	4.16	1
there he will get it prioritizing a b of	11600.88	4.68	1
the map control being able to get tuis	11603.2	4.32	1
pushed up on a rubble and then	11605.56	5.4	1
teleported into a retake for the team if	11607.52	6.44	0
necessary loud a very much needed round	11610.96	4.96	0
every single one of these last rounds	11613.96	4.16	0
needs to be theirs with the pressure	11615.92	4.88	0
Sentinels is adding to this Fifth and	11618.12	5.04	1
final map of the Grand Final	11620.8	5.96	1
two more rounds a possibility	11623.16	3.6	1
here size of	11627.08	7.0	1
relief and now they focus on another	11630.0	7.88	1
round any alts on Deck not really for	11634.08	4.76	1
for	11637.88	3.08	1
loud but they are going to go ahead take	11638.84	3.84	1
that Rubble control and try to just get	11640.96	3.519	1
a better read on Sentinels they need	11642.68	3.84	1
every bit of the beginning of these	11644.48	4.681	1
rounds in their favor loud does so	11646.52	5.16	1
that's a pickup one away from orb now	11649.16	5.56	0
for a second or	11651.68	3.04	0
ultimate and if anything here they have	11654.96	4.359	0
that ultimate available for tuis if he	11657.76	3.88	0
wants to go for that TP in the back of	11659.32	3.801	0
the seaside to help and it's being	11661.64	3.759	0
pinged out by Sentinels Sentinels	11663.12	4.159	0
putting pings all the way through the	11665.4	3.641	1
back of Spawn here and it's right over	11667.28	5.841	1
the members of loud face your fear	11669.04	5.279	1
that's where they're trying to Ping	11673.12	3.239	1
where they want to initiate the	11674.32	5.0	1
Nightfall pain shells thrown by Z space	11676.36	4.481	1
has been gained Prowler pushing back	11679.32	3.361	1
towards the waterfall qck still still	11680.84	4.08	1
anchoring behind the pillar after that	11682.68	4.36	1
plant though show stopper available by Z	11684.92	4.0	1
beautiful flash do not allow for him to	11687.04	4.04	1
get Space off the showstopper does some	11688.92	5.08	1
damage on the qck down to 5 HP boombot	11691.08	4.48	0
about to come out through the smoke the	11694.0	3.16	0
paranoia countered by loud for the back	11695.56	3.719	0
of the spawn John CA gets a St by kill	11697.16	4.4	1
onto qck as s do has to move in with the	11699.28	3.801	1
rest but they're getting delayed by the	11701.56	3.64	1
utility of Sentinels on the PO plan a	11703.08	4.04	1
five versus three make that a four	11705.2	3.64	1
versus three Advantage for the Sentinels	11707.12	3.92	1
as well as L and the rest cannot move	11708.84	4.559	0
forward for loud finally it's tens that	11711.04	4.319	0
gets picked off two ninos storms onto	11713.4	4.241	0
the spike delayed available for zelus	11715.36	3.641	1
there is the Hop and now they're moving	11717.64	2.719	0
forward but finally they got rid of that	11719.0	4.479	0
udil it's at a halfway the swing out two	11720.36	6.521	1
with the second tap and Sassy gets that	11723.48	8.601	0
pick holy close call by both squads	11726.88	7.439	0
round seeing that play come to fruition	11732.08	4.239	1
for Sentinels I started thinking you	11734.32	4.761	1
guys planted for not Mound and you guys	11736.32	5.481	1
got you got guys outside the site loud	11739.08	5.399	1
also recognizing the plant position and	11741.8	5.36	1
for a defense that means they have some	11744.48	5.121	1
members in sight nobody plants down on	11747.16	5.72	1
that platform and all play Mound loud	11749.6	5.639	1
assessing the situation beautifully and	11752.88	6.04	1
dropping the members they needed holy	11755.24	6.721	1
moly not enough	11758.92	6.8	1
though it's tough for them it is tough	11761.96	5.96	1
for sure they're able to come back	11765.72	3.84	1
Sentinels even though they planted on	11767.92	5.6	1
that platform and get the get the round	11769.56	7.839	1
contact play Z is on fire Superstar now	11773.52	6.36	1
for Sentinels continues to lead the	11777.4	5.561	1
charge on all of these hits of the	11779.88	7.04	0
attack out although on the other side we	11782.96	5.84	0
did see the push from qck out towards	11786.92	5.359	0
the a main evening up the tally weapon	11788.8	5.32	0
upgraded at this corner looking to get	11792.28	4.401	1
upgraded as senos goes for the plant but	11794.12	3.88	1
there's that	11796.68	3.599	1
backstab John cuy with the plant gets	11798.0	3.88	1
the pit that's going to make it	11800.28	4.321	1
difficult now for allowed to	11801.88	2.72	0
retake second he sparman cannot be sorry	11804.64	9.4	0
all right very cool uh moving in now Les	11810.88	6.24	1
qck to do what they can here HP going to	11814.04	5.96	1
be going way down oh and short and close	11817.12	7.0	1
swings across alone oneon-one tap on the	11820.0	6.72	1
spike John cutie just staying outside of	11824.12	4.88	1
it gambling that he's not going to stick	11826.72	5.0	1
it just got spotted down to 11 Blaze	11829.0	5.279	1
wall now another tap John cuy forced to	11831.72	5.04	0
run in but now there's not enough time	11834.28	5.0	0
cus with another tap got it John cuy	11836.76	4.599	0
with the rest of the patience of	11839.28	5.641	0
Sentinels have they finished a half a	11841.36	7.801	0
102 what an incredible first half final	11844.92	7.6	1
match from Sentinels still on fire this	11849.16	5.319	1
late in the day this late through all	11852.52	4.719	0
these strategies John cuy and zelus	11854.48	5.281	1
still have a strap book to flip the	11857.24	5.801	1
pages through loud having having so much	11859.76	5.719	1
trouble figuring out what is the entry	11863.04	4.64	1
on this Sentinels composition how to get	11865.48	4.201	1
to the entry with all of their members	11867.68	4.44	1
Sentinels picks them apart one by one as	11869.68	4.519	1
they go for the rotations they get into	11872.12	5.44	1
position and here again just the time	11874.2	7.08	1
game being danced around Sentinels have	11877.56	6.919	1
been in so in control so much throughout	11881.28	6.12	1
this series and now the final map of 102	11884.48	5.441	1
10-2 with three rounds remaining for the	11887.4	4.281	1
Sentinels to be crowned the kickoff	11889.92	4.399	1
champion but SEL have a big cushion	11891.68	4.84	1
right now win this pistol will be	11894.32	4.801	1
everything and L has an uphill battle to	11896.52	4.64	1
fight a steep one2 as they take the	11899.12	4.239	1
attack pistol around underway and it	11901.16	4.36	1
comes down to this player right here for	11903.36	5.201	1
qck they don't have a composition that	11905.52	5.839	0
allows for them to do the explosion on	11908.56	3.96	0
the map control that they're trying to	11911.36	2.84	0
get the sight control that Z currently	11912.52	4.04	1
has for Sentinels so how will work the	11914.2	4.641	1
attack now with this type of	11916.56	4.56	1
comp here looking to make as little	11918.84	3.92	1
noise as possible looks like they might	11921.12	3.92	1
catch a paranoia here if they do gets	11922.76	3.4	1
into	11925.04	3.8	1
position right behind Rubble oh dear oh	11926.16	4.36	1
the Wall came down as well paranoid	11928.84	3.479	1
moving forward a one for one make that a	11930.52	3.6	1
two for one in favor of the SOS control	11932.32	3.761	1
towards the rubble as well hit by the	11934.12	5.239	1
Seas killed by tens again with a	11936.08	7.159	1
hatrick multi kills this whole series	11939.36	6.481	1
for the star player not only B zek but	11943.24	6.561	1
also T finding comfort in this role as	11945.84	8.76	1
Omen and dominating this kickoff so far	11949.8	8.0	1
two's with the backstab two for his name	11954.6	6.92	1
zelis is low on HP but it's a backstab	11957.8	6.32	1
for backstab John cutie is also there	11961.52	5.12	1
looking to move behind 30 seconds left	11964.12	5.359	1
signs to think otherwise looks like SOS	11966.64	6.24	1
wants to give up the spike at least for	11969.48	6.641	1
now they get to safety on this one red	11972.88	5.399	1
the play so far can't count out who	11976.12	4.52	1
though they hear yeah zelus hears that	11978.28	4.361	1
run John cue has to heaven	11980.64	3.48	1
getting into position so this will be	11982.64	4.04	1
money here for loud if loud do lose	11984.12	4.319	0
they're going to be buying next	11986.68	4.679	1
round expect the buy from loud Sentinels	11988.44	5.84	1
will too and it looks like we're going	11991.36	6.681	1
hard onto this one 11 to2 now do they go	11994.28	5.801	1
for it there's a stinger there's a few	11998.04	4.279	1
let's see the replay on the round	12000.08	4.84	1
looking at how they orchestrated this it	12002.32	5.561	1
was a lot on the fade whatever fade	12004.92	4.88	1
could see from link whatever sassy could	12007.88	4.96	1
look was then the hit from 10 on	12009.8	5.92	1
paranoia everybody then into it second	12012.84	5.08	1
went down first in that and they knew	12015.72	4.679	1
the play would still go through that as	12017.92	5.8	1
well the play that you saw from John cue	12020.4	6.04	1
the snake bite and also spraying in	12023.72	4.479	1
knowing that it was going to be a plant	12026.44	3.241	1
that's going to be unorthodox just	12028.2	3.881	1
trying to get it down for tuis and still	12029.68	5.2	1
manages to get that pick fragon IG	12032.08	5.48	1
calling perfectly for sels and steps up	12034.88	5.16	1
for these kills when he needs to the	12037.56	4.2	1
perfect piece to the puzzle right now	12040.04	4.92	0
for for Sentinels to close this series	12041.76	5.88	0
two rounds away as loud as you mentioned	12044.96	6.319	1
Riv is forced on a buy a main control	12047.64	5.4	1
Prowler just went through b for	12051.28	3.401	0
Sentinels so they have a bit of an idea	12053.04	4.359	0
of how long the timing will be and now	12054.68	4.519	1
the Trail Blazer alerts them a little	12057.4	4.96	0
bit more spike is b or sorry C here for	12059.2	6.681	0
loud fian does get the hit onto the jump	12062.36	5.201	0
spot but thankfully sedak is there with	12065.88	4.16	0
the heal Les is back and topped and now	12067.56	4.4	0
they're pting towards the seaside as	12070.04	3.56	0
mentioned because of that pressure and	12071.96	3.64	0
that control that SEL C has on that a	12073.6	4.639	1
site utility being broken on that cite	12075.6	4.28	1
as well snake bite to theay snake bite	12078.24	4.281	1
to push John cuy away as well first	12079.88	4.04	1
Conta now in the back of the pillar to	12082.52	3.24	1
that cided zelus with the stinger out of	12083.92	4.16	0
bullets flashed and pulled away and now	12085.76	4.84	0
it forces SEL to play the	12088.08	4.8	0
retake they're they got to stay in sight	12090.6	4.12	0
for this plant it's going to get real	12092.88	3.76	1
sketchy if they're all outside on Mound	12094.72	3.559	1
so you see them piling into water here	12096.64	4.4	1
they still have the flank from tuis but	12098.28	5.2	1
looks like T is ready ready for that one	12101.04	4.359	1
so far Taps the door or looking for the	12103.48	3.88	0
paranoia of the backstab missed the	12105.4	4.201	0
opportunity to close him down SE being	12107.36	3.92	0
pulled out after the shot to try to push	12109.6	4.08	1
them back once again sasi finally try to	12111.28	4.601	1
lead the charge but cenen strikes first	12113.68	4.12	1
it's back and forth but louder still	12115.88	4.64	1
holding the post plan celus is low on HP	12117.8	5.439	0
po by Kine with the classic it's up to	12120.52	7.32	0
only one more member T the time against	12123.24	6.921	1
them runs back out through the smoke	12127.84	4.92	0
tries to make it expensive in	12130.16	5.6	0
but loud holds down the post PL on their	12132.76	6.04	1
Force by Sentinels feels the sting on	12135.76	5.4	1
that round and almost necessary win	12138.8	5.12	1
game's over if loud dropped the Stinger	12141.16	5.96	1
by round but no they persevere they find	12143.92	5.96	1
a way to shred Sentinels and then they	12147.12	5.119	1
low plant in the sight knowing Stingers	12149.88	4.599	1
cannot win that fight from Mound and	12152.24	5.2	1
they cause chaos on Sentinels retake	12154.48	4.84	0
absolutely swarming the members of sen	12157.44	4.281	1
taking them down so a few free upgrades	12159.32	4.441	1
upgrades for loud here Sentinels back	12161.72	4.719	1
down on the Low by loud needs to carry	12163.76	5.32	1
these rounds for just about forever	12166.44	3.681	1
we'll see what	12169.08	3.68	1
happens a pressure will be given for now	12170.12	5.92	1
is a retake for Sen and Loud a lot of	12172.76	5.639	0
control on the map here really playing	12176.04	3.96	1
it slow to not make a mistake back and	12178.4	4.121	0
forth as they tempt any fight forever	12180.0	4.16	1
definitely seems like very long when	12182.52	2.919	1
you're trying to find Rune to Breathe	12184.16	3.159	1
Here trailing behind by eight rounds are	12185.44	3.92	1
allowed and already look how early these	12187.32	3.281	1
Trail lasers are coming from but it	12189.36	3.641	1
forces out the push the low that you	12190.6	4.679	1
have from SEL through the smoke Tu is	12193.0	3.72	1
ready for that drops them both with the	12195.28	3.601	1
Stinger allows for them to Pivot across	12196.72	3.559	0
but look at this reposition from John	12198.88	5.12	1
cue he decided to fall at behind his	12200.28	6.241	1
teammate's body the paranoia to come out	12204.0	5.319	1
at least one kill but out of that loud	12206.52	4.6	1
has full control of B full control of	12209.32	4.481	1
the map and now control of the spike	12211.12	5.4	1
planted Spike	12213.8	4.399	1
planted that's going to give him the	12216.52	5.36	1
contact not even need it well done here	12218.2	6.0	1
L converts two rounds in a row senal	12221.88	5.359	1
canot get the surprise play remember	12224.2	4.761	1
though if we're going back to the basics	12227.24	3.721	1
as well of this map a three side map	12228.96	3.84	1
you've mentioned here Riv very similar	12230.96	3.6	1
to Haven great ways to be able to	12232.8	4.0	1
default across the map great ways to	12234.56	4.4	1
actually pull rotations away and get a	12236.8	4.96	1
very strong attack side so SEL showed a	12238.96	5.6	1
very good 102 half on their attack but	12241.76	4.88	1
you definitely know that loud has what	12244.56	4.16	1
it takes and can do the same thing I	12246.64	3.92	1
mean they just pulled off a full Stinger	12248.72	5.24	1
221 fake strap right yeah anything is on	12250.56	5.919	0
the table right now back to guns on both	12253.96	5.439	0
sides 11 to four is no pressure for loud	12256.48	4.96	0
they're feeling the z0 on the scoreboard	12259.4	4.681	0
as they take shots and T however starts	12261.44	5.161	0
us off the haad information tends to s	12264.08	4.199	1
for attack while looking at the mean map	12266.6	3.599	1
and got the kill paranoid to push him	12268.28	3.641	1
away trying to fall back but there's a	12270.2	3.721	1
stin bite to not allow him from that	12271.92	3.68	1
Deep Cover but at least his teammates	12273.92	3.84	1
are there cover going out a little back	12275.6	4.24	1
and forth Sentinels will regain position	12277.76	3.92	1
of the rubble area after grabbing one so	12279.84	5.639	1
the 5v4 conversion now on send shoulders	12281.68	5.599	1
to get the W on this	12285.48	4.201	1
round this is where Sashi comes in or	12287.28	4.401	1
I'm sorry Sak comes into play the mid-	12289.68	4.96	0
round call what can happen Double Take	12291.68	5.28	0
on both sides of that mid area tu's just	12294.64	5.16	0
from mid and they're waiting on less	12296.96	4.84	0
maybe a little more info maybe a push	12299.8	4.88	1
but sen have not been giving that	12301.8	5.8	1
push heard the jumps the haunt here to	12304.68	6.32	1
he's forced to break it and give his	12307.6	5.08	0
position away	12311.0	3.279	0
they have this Rolling Thunder for Cen	12312.68	3.32	0
he made it all the way down towards the	12314.28	4.12	0
bottom and as the nms come out they	12316.0	4.72	0
could just wait for that timing all	12318.4	4.161	0
coming through gets cancel as twois is	12320.72	3.32	1
trying to find somebody towards that	12322.56	4.679	1
sight 30 seconds left but once again	12324.04	5.88	1
senel playing the	12327.24	5.0	1
retake waited out the Molly's going for	12329.92	4.399	1
the plant another plant that considers	12332.24	4.2	1
that loud has to stay inside with the	12334.32	4.201	1
Odin the se's got him to just sprayed	12336.44	3.92	1
through and now snake bights to delay	12338.52	3.16	1
and that's no rolling thunder going to	12340.36	2.641	1
push him back there's only 12 seconds	12341.68	3.32	1
left on the clock Forest into go for the	12343.0	3.72	1
stick but the sprays are not coming in	12345.0	3.68	1
this time around plant is down the push	12346.72	4.0	1
from tuis does not get the surprise kill	12348.68	4.44	1
there onto SEL TS on to rotate back from	12350.72	4.84	0
the spawn hot comes through sadak is all	12353.12	5.279	0
alone sedak gets two but gets dropped	12355.56	5.839	0
right after Sentinels with the theuse	12358.4	5.761	1
and Sentinel round a way of breathing	12361.4	4.361	1
this	12364.16	5.159	1
series oh my gosh that's the defuse they	12365.76	5.84	1
go for John cue or no zalis that's going	12369.32	4.481	1
to be an Alor towards the lock down	12371.6	4.759	1
anything that helps them secure these	12373.8	6.12	1
rounds from loud loud is able to get	12376.36	5.601	1
into the sights they do it as a death	12379.92	5.399	1
ball they squeeze in but the plants have	12381.96	5.92	1
been so tough for loud to get in a good	12385.32	4.841	1
position the low plants just on platform	12387.88	4.559	1
are not allowing them good defensive	12390.16	4.319	1
setups Sentinels comes in and just	12392.44	4.641	1
swarms from all angles in the end 12 to	12394.48	4.441	1
four now we are going to still have that	12397.08	4.319	1
Odin online for the side of Sentinels	12398.92	4.479	1
but loud are able to present now with	12401.4	4.84	1
full vandals just low armor on tuis in	12403.4	5.0	1
this Rolling Thunder they're going to	12406.24	3.601	1
fight for a rubble	12408.4	3.441	1
control it's going to be all about the	12409.84	4.16	1
map before the fights first they have to	12411.84	4.359	1
play this round in layers if loud wants	12414.0	3.52	1
to get through	12416.2	3.481	0
S do hear a little bit of damage being	12417.52	3.879	0
done here through the smoke but it's	12419.68	5.2	0
inflicted onto loud sedak and Les tagged	12421.4	5.161	0
a little bit remember this Rolling	12424.88	3.519	1
Thunder available not used on the	12426.56	3.08	1
seaside when they thought they had	12428.4	3.481	1
control this time though Z gets the open	12429.64	4.639	1
four kills away you thought you would	12431.88	3.96	1
have a rolling thunder open up the a	12434.28	4.2	1
site but instead it's reopening the door	12435.84	6.0	1
and sneaking Q	12438.48	3.361	1
around they have no idea what's behind	12442.32	3.761	0
them they don't know if somebody's in in	12444.52	2.719	0
baby door they don't know if somebody's	12446.08	3.319	0
now behind them at a main they have to	12447.24	4.601	1
move and loud can only go forward here	12449.4	3.96	1
that Rolling Thunder still ready could	12451.84	4.479	1
cover all of B they have qck just	12453.36	5.481	1
lurking waiting but nobody from	12456.32	4.04	1
Sentinels is stepping into the danger	12458.84	3.0	1
zone right now they're waiting for a	12460.36	3.441	1
plant knowledge loud just with their	12461.84	4.68	1
regular stop and go under the pressure	12463.8	4.76	0
out of elimination yet at the brink of	12466.52	4.959	1
elimination does these plays 2K trying	12468.56	4.48	1
to go for the hero one trying to see if	12471.48	4.161	0
he can catch one off guard got your at	12473.04	4.279	0
least to get the plant	12475.64	5.44	1
down 5v3 Rolling Thunder prepped and	12477.32	5.361	1
ready from the tree position they're	12481.08	2.8	1
going to actually try to rotate a little	12482.68	3.2	1
bit around tuis can have a big Flank In	12483.88	4.68	1
the End a few of these seconds being	12485.88	4.72	1
wasted getting to the spike but s still	12488.56	3.56	1
have a lot of time on the clock	12490.6	3.48	0
important to keep cow alive right now	12492.12	3.64	0
for the Rolling Thunder and he also has	12494.08	5.0	1
Aftershock holding the tree is the most	12495.76	5.4	1
important position but senel are looking	12499.08	3.319	1
to fight right back there's the	12501.16	3.119	1
Aftershock there's a swing out from 10	12502.4	3.8	1
but gets the nine and now the tap on	12504.28	3.641	1
that Spike two he's dropping one it's a	12506.2	3.961	1
two versus two right inside trying to	12507.92	4.24	1
stick it another one to fall it's all up	12510.16	4.48	1
to Z who does get the K trying to stick	12512.16	5.44	1
this bik he gets to the fuse with the	12514.64	6.24	1
red clutch and sendal are going to be	12517.6	6.12	1
your America's kickoff	12520.88	4.88	1
