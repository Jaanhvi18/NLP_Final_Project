============================================
Key Points:

- Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
- In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't.
